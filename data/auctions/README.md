# Auctions Data

## auctions.json

Auction events where players were acquired through the UFA/RFA auction process (not through the draft or FA wire).

This is generated by:
1. Taking all contracts from `contracts.json`
2. Filtering out players who were drafted that season
3. "Unrolling" unsigned player trades to find the original auction winner

**Schema (per entry):**
- `season` — year of the auction
- `sleeperId` — Sleeper player ID, or `null` for historical players
- `name` — player name
- `positions` — array (e.g. `["QB"]`, `["DL", "LB"]`)
- `rosterId` — franchise roster ID of the auction winner
- `originalOwner` — owner name who won the auction
- `salary` — auction price / contract salary
- `startYear`, `endYear` — contract term

### Trade Unrolling

When a player is traded while still unsigned (before setting their contract), the `contracts.json` shows them with the final owner, not who won the auction. This generator traces back through unsigned trades to find the original auction winner.

For example: If Schex wins Player X at auction, then trades them unsigned to Koci, who signs them — `contracts.json` shows Koci as the owner, but `auctions.json` will correctly show Schex as the auction winner.

## Generating

```bash
node data/auctions/generate.js
node data/auctions/generate.js --dry-run
```

Requires `contracts.json`, `drafts.json`, and `trades.json` to already exist.
