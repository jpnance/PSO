me: yo
chriskoci: ni hao
dgrysen: SUP
me: looks like we just had a trade go down
chriskoci: last year i was told i couldn't trade during the draft?
me: no?
  because you did trade terrence mcgee
chriskoci: wait
djschexnayder: but you made a trade during the draft
chriskoci: wrong league
   haha
ksomandar: so what was the trade
me: syed gives lee evans ($55) to daniel in exchange for kevin walter ($42) and $12 of 2009 cash
  neither players have contracts set yet
  i'm making this update right now
  schex: any word on whether james is coming?
djschexnayder: oh shit, yeah
   he's declared
   done
me: alrighty
ksomandar: so its on luke right
djschexnayder: anyone skyping today?
me: gimme just a second to get set
  the trade should be reflected now
djschexnayder: did luke declare last week?
dgrysen: yup looks good
ksomandar: is luke done?
   he only has 4 bucks
dgrysen: he declared last time I'm pretty sure
trevor.highland: yeah he's out
chriskoci: who else is out? john?
trevor.highland: he left early on the first day
ksomandar: yeah
me: luke, john, and james are all done
  and everybody else is here
  awesome
  alright, one quick vote to have
djschexnayder: in favor
me: do we want a "going once/sold" system today or would we prefer to stick with "going once/going twice/sold"? i'll always revert to "once/twice/sold" if there's any response bidding, in either case
dgrysen: going once only
trevor.highland: sure let's get this thing finished
ksomandar: thats fine
djschexnayder: agreed
chriskoci: aye
me: alright, if there's no response action to the initial bid, going once and sold
