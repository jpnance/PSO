[15:59] <ks1> is there a set time this thing is gonna end tonight
[16:01] <@jpnance> well
[16:01] <@jpnance> i don't think we'll go past 10pm
[16:01] <@jpnance> central
[16:01] <@jpnance> if there's a point where people are just getting horribly tired of it, we can knock off early
[16:01] <@jpnance> either way, i'd like to get through as much as possible tonight
[16:03] <ks1> i think im gonna suck at this. never done one of these
[16:05] <dutchboyx9> how are you goign to do the timer?
[16:05] <@jpnance> i'll just be eyeballing it, really
[16:06] <dutchboyx9> ballsy
[16:07] <ks1> timer for what
[16:07] <dutchboyx9> last chance to bid
[16:09] <@jpnance> i'll be entering the results into the rosters as we go along
[16:09] <@jpnance> unfortunately, ESPN won't let us look at the players in free agency while i'm doing that
[16:09] <@jpnance> trying to find a way around it
[16:09] <ks1> oh damn that sucks
[16:12] <@jpnance> you know
[16:12] <@jpnance> i think i'll just do it in an HTML table or some shit
[16:12] <@jpnance> because being able to see stats is more important
[16:15] <ks1> fuck time is going by too slowly
[16:16] <@jpnance> haha
[16:16] <@jpnance> yeah, i wanna get this over with
[16:18] <ks1> im doing this mock auction draft on espn, just to get the hang of it, i just bid 55 for LT or so i thought, but i ended up with portis for that price
[16:23] <@jpnance> haha
[16:35] <ks1> then i left the draft out of embarrassment
[16:35] <ks1> that was the first player too
[16:36] <@jpnance> hahaha
[16:36] <@jpnance> i like it
03[16:36] * trevor (n=trevor@cpe-70-124-83-104.austin.res.rr.com) has joined #dynastyleague
[16:37] <ks1> i think i got the hang of what not to do
[16:38] <@jpnance> yeah
[16:38] <@jpnance> also, keep in mind that the goal of that kind of auction draft is to spend all the money
[16:38] <@jpnance> but because of the contracts and shit we'll be doing, you might not necessarily want to do that
[16:38] <@jpnance> you can if you want, of course
[16:38] <@jpnance> but yeah
[16:40] <trevor> kj
[16:40] <dutchboyx9> how much do you have LT going for on your board trevor
[16:40] <trevor> oh 350
[16:40] <dutchboyx9> yesss
[16:40] <dutchboyx9> 351
[16:42] <ks1> 350, wow
[16:43] <trevor> pat give me mod privileges
[16:43] <trevor> i _need_ them
[16:44] <@jpnance> i don't know what you're talking about
[16:44] <@jpnance> because i don't habitually use IRC
[16:44] <@jpnance> and i am unfamiliar as to what its capabilities are
[16:44] <trevor> oh i want to kick people and dumb shit like that
03[16:46] * jpnance changes topic to 'http://whattheballs.com/~jpnance/dynasty/'

03[16:46] * nomnomnom (i=42449116@gateway/web/ajax/mibbit.com/x-8a510aad7c4456af) has joined #dynastyleague
[16:46] <@jpnance> since we're doing this in a pretty hokey fashion, i figured i should give you guys as much help as possible
[16:46] <nomnomnom> nomming
[16:47] <@jpnance> cash.html shows everybody's money run-down
[16:47] <@jpnance> "30-player bid" is the maximum bid a player can make if he wants to have a 30-man roster
03[16:47] * nomnomnom is now known as Guest11358
[16:47] <@jpnance> but nobody is obligated to actually have a 30-man roster
[16:47] <Guest11358> why did I get renamed
[16:47] <ks1> oh really
[16:47] <@jpnance> yeah
[16:47] <ks1> well then cool

[16:48] <@jpnance> results.html is just the running result table of the draft
[16:48] <nomming> if you rename me again I'm going to be pissed
[16:48] <@jpnance> it's a really lousy substitute to see who's still available and who isn't
[16:48] <@jpnance> but it'll have to do
[16:48] <@jpnance> and the other files are the running rosters for each owner
[16:48] <nomming> where's my big board
[16:49] <@jpnance> and i'll be updating each one of those, so be prepared to refresh a lot tonight
[16:49] <nomming> why isn't there a big board that you just take players off of
[16:49] <nomming> eh mr. nance?
[16:49] <@jpnance> i don't know
[16:49] <@jpnance> i should also note
[16:50] <@jpnance> on the cash.html
[16:50] <nomming> is 30 player bid the max bid?
[16:50] <@jpnance> from left to right, that's the nomination order
[16:50] <@jpnance> if you want a 30-player roster, yeah
[16:50] <@jpnance> the general maximum bid is whatever you have left because i'm not mandating 30-player rosters
[16:50] <nomming> shouldn't it start as 971
[16:50] <ks1> left to right?
[16:50] <ks1> where do you see that
[16:50] <@jpnance> yeah, sorry

[17:15] <j-j-j-j-j-john> thank you
03[17:15] * trevor (n=trevor@cpe-70-124-83-104.austin.res.rr.com) has joined #dynastyleague
[17:15] <j-j-j-j-j-john> nope I'm #2
03[17:15] * Texas_Schexes is now known as schex
[17:15] <koci2> where's the nomination order?
[17:15] <j-j-j-j-j-john> Trevor is up first
[17:16] <@jpnance> is everybody appropriately named?
[17:16] <trevor> how in the fucking world is this going to work
[17:16] <j-j-j-j-j-john> in cash.html
[17:16] <trevor> oh Adrian peterson
[17:16] <trevor> 350
03[17:16] * jpnance sets mode: +m
[17:16] <@jpnance> alright
[17:16] <@jpnance> we're +m
[17:16] <@jpnance> so only i can talk for the moment
[17:16] <@jpnance> http://whattheballs.com/~jpnance/dynasty/
[17:16] <@jpnance> if you go there, you'll find a bunch of files
[17:16] <@jpnance> cash.html is the remaining cash situations
[17:16] <@jpnance> how many spots that owner has left
[17:16] <@jpnance> and what his maximum bid is if he intends to fill a 30-man roster
[17:17] <@jpnance> i'm not mandating that a roster have 30 spots filled, though
[17:17] <@jpnance> so, in general, an owner's maximum bid is however much he has left
02[17:17] * trevor (n=trevor@cpe-70-124-83-104.austin.res.rr.com) Quit (Client Quit)
[17:17] <@jpnance> results.html is the running results table
[17:17] <@jpnance> pretty self explanatory
[17:17] <@jpnance> i wish there were a better way to tell who's been taken and who hasn't but, unfortunately, there isn't
03[17:17] * trevor (n=trevor@cpe-70-124-83-104.austin.res.rr.com) has joined #dynastyleague
[17:18] <@jpnance> if you need a way to compare people within our scoring system, you can go to the league page and search the free agents wire normally
[17:18] <@jpnance> the other pages are just each owner's roster up to that point
[17:18] <@jpnance> i'll be updating this all as fast as i can so, if you're interested in such things, be prepared to refresh a lot
[17:18] <@jpnance> the nomination order is:
[17:19] <@jpnance> trevor, john, keyon, koci, patrick, syed, daniel, jeff, schex, james
[17:19] <@jpnance> so, in a few minutes
[17:19] <@jpnance> trevor will yell out a name
[17:19] <@jpnance> and then you guys just type in whatever you want to bid
[17:19] <@jpnance> hopefully, it'll resemble a real auction
[17:19] <@jpnance> at some point, i'll decide that the bidding has slowed down enough to declare "going once, going twice, sold"
[17:20] <@jpnance> (in separate messages, natch.)
[17:20] <@jpnance> unfortunately, i can't limit the talking to only bids and nominations
[17:20] <@jpnance> so i ask that you guys keep conversation to google talk or AIM or whatever
[17:20] <@jpnance> pretty please with a cherry on top
[17:20] <@jpnance> a few notes
[17:20] <@jpnance> jeff's not here and probably won't be
[17:21] <@jpnance> he gave schex some set of rules for drafting for him
[17:21] <@jpnance> so you'll just have to trust schex is being fair if he ever gets into a bidding war with jeff
[17:21] <@jpnance> essentially, schex is drafting for two teams
[17:21] <@jpnance> hopefully, he'll be pretty clear about which bid is intended for which owner
[17:21] <@jpnance> also, james is not here either, but charles is drafting for him
[17:21] <@jpnance> any questions?
03[17:22] * jpnance sets mode: -m
[17:22] <ks1> picking up a FA after draft
[17:22] <ks1> doesnt cost a thing right
[17:22] <@jpnance> costs $1
[17:22] <daniel> $1
[17:22] <ks1> ok
[17:22] <@jpnance> all undrafted players cost $1 to pick up
[17:22] <j-j-j-j-j-john> what are the rules for if a player is dropped
[17:22] <@jpnance> he retains his market value for his next owner
[17:22] <@jpnance> and his contract disappears
[17:22] <j-j-j-j-j-john> what happens to the dropping owners salary cap
[17:22] <SyedAshrafulla> 13cap hit
[17:22] <daniel> 1/2
[17:22] <SyedAshrafulla> 13 50% of contract
[17:23] <@jpnance> the owner gets relieved of half of that player's value, and we round up
[17:23] <j-j-j-j-j-john> k

[20:28] <syed> 13it goes fast though

[20:28] <j-j-j-j-j-john> 10I'm done drafting though

[20:31] <ks1> 30 players is way too many
[20:32] <syed> 13thats the point
[20:32] <ks1> but i guess you dont have to have that many
[20:32] <@jpnance> keyon
[20:32] <syed> 13there should be no FA depth
[20:32] <@jpnance> you don't have to draft 30
[20:32] <@jpnance> you can say you're done whenever you want
[20:32] <ks1> cool cool
[20:32] <syed> 13i love that jeff ran out on Terence McGee
[20:33] <@jpnance> haha
[20:33] <@jpnance> i should check these numbers for consistency
[20:33] <@jpnance> i almost assuredly made a mistake or ten
[20:33] <syed> 13all of the results numbers are accurate
[20:34] <ks1> this was my first auction, and i think i came out pretty poorly so far. would have changed it up a lot
[20:34] <ks1> still a lotta fun tho
[20:34] <@jpnance> yeah, my team is horrible

[20:36] <ks1> your rbs are solid, and WR can be had for cheaper at the end of the draft, not too bad
[20:36] <trevor> i'm not sure how much I overpaid for peterson
[20:37] <@jpnance> well, if addai and tomlinson both went for $360
[20:37] <@jpnance> i would say at least $40
[20:37] <trevor> i mean addai seemed to be a bigg stretch
[20:37] <trevor> peterson is by far #1 player in dynasty
[20:37] <@jpnance> i have no clue how you did it
[20:37] <@jpnance> but i thought you ended up with a great team
[20:37] <@jpnance> and you still have some cash to work with, too
[20:38] <trevor> yeah i need another wr and a couple of rookies
[20:38] <trevor> and i'll be set
[20:38] <@jpnance> not buying peterson "by far"
[20:38] <ks1> who the hell is aldridge anyways
[20:38] <ks1> only guy i had never heard of
[20:38] <@jpnance> i would listen to an argument that he's the #1 fantasy player
[20:38] <@jpnance> but he's not obviously the best
[20:38] <trevor> alridge went to high school with me
[20:38] <trevor> ran a 4.26
[20:38] <trevor> and is a scat back type
[20:39] <trevor> not even sure if he'll make the team
[20:39] <ks1> are you the bronco fan? i remember one of yall was
[20:39] <trevor> yeah i am
[20:40] <@jpnance> you guys have any thoughts on the draft tonight?
[20:40] <@jpnance> anything that worked well or didn't?
[20:41] <trevor> so peterson is it worked much better than expected
[20:41] <trevor> can you get players added to rosters tonight so we can sift through what's left tomorrow
[20:41] <@jpnance> yep
[20:41] <@jpnance> doing that right now
[20:42] <ks1> did i read the settings correctly in that each punt return yard is one point?
[20:42] <@jpnance> probably so
[20:42] <@jpnance> we're borrowing the scoring system from the main league most of us play in
[20:43] <@jpnance> it worked pretty well last year except that defense was a little undervalued
[20:43] <@jpnance> actually
[20:43] <@jpnance> trevor
[20:43] <@jpnance> you know what
[20:43] <@jpnance> well
[20:43] <@jpnance> no, nevermind, i can do it
[20:43] <ks1> im pretty happy with my D, except i overpaid for Ryans. 
[20:44] <ks1> i saw where Ware went, so i picked accordingly
[20:44] <trevor> who all do you have?
[20:44] <ks1> but urlacher and lofa were cheap compared
[20:44] <@jpnance> yeah, tatupu went cheap
[20:44] <ks1> it seems picking one of the first players in a position means you will overpay
[20:44] <ks1> ryans, trent cole, sean jones s cle
[20:45] <trevor> yeah that's solid
[20:45] <trevor> the ryans overpay was bad
[20:45] <ks1> yah
[20:46] <ks1> allen for 21 was good pat
[20:48] <ks1> damn schex did awesome

03[16:58] * ckoci (i=467295b6@gateway/web/ajax/mibbit.com/x-146572dcbe2c34a0) has joined #dynastyleague
[16:58] <ckoci> test
[16:58] <trevor> ping
[16:58] <@jpnance> looks like syed's ready to go anyway
[16:58] <daniel> zingers
[16:58] <@jpnance> no so worries
03[16:58] * SyedAshrafulla (i=cf97f34a@gateway/web/ajax/mibbit.com/x-101d39602d741223) has joined #dynastyleague
[16:58] <SyedAshrafulla> i am here
[16:58] <@jpnance> alright
[16:58] <trevor> any suggestions on who i should nominate
[16:58] <@jpnance> so, a few announcements
03[16:58] * daniel is now known as JennyHumphrey
[16:58] <SyedAshrafulla> for some reason it wouldnt let me use syed
03[16:58] * SyedAshrafulla is now known as syed
[16:58] <syed> ah there we go
[16:58] <@jpnance> first of all, john's officially done drafting
[16:59] <@jpnance> so nobody will be nominated in his place
03[16:59] * JennyHumphrey is now known as daniel
[16:59] <@jpnance> and, even if he comes back, he won't be able to re-enter the draft
[16:59] <@jpnance> if that affects the way you draft or give contracts out, take note
[16:59] <syed> now Patrick Crayton wont be overvalued, got it
[16:59] <@jpnance> second, given how long we took last night, we might do a day 3, so i have two questions
[17:00] <@jpnance> a) how long can you guys go tonight?
[17:00] <daniel> ALL NIGHT LONG
[17:00] <@jpnance> b) could you go tomorrow as well?
[17:00] <syed> all night all night
[17:00] <ks1> rather just get it done today
[17:00] <trevor> let people leave as they please
[17:00] <trevor> and we'll go til people call uncle
[17:00] <@jpnance> well, here's the thing
[17:00] <@jpnance> at any point, you can declare that you're done drafting
[17:01] <@jpnance> but you can't re-enter
[17:01] <@jpnance> and you can't just pass a nomination when it's your turn
[17:01] <@jpnance> either you nominate somebody or you're done drafting for good
[17:01] <trevor> k deal
[17:01] <Jeffaray> that rule sucks
[17:01] <ks1> why
[17:01] <@jpnance> they all do
[17:01] <james_r> commish doesn't fuck around
[17:01] <ks1> is everyone here?
[17:02] <trevor> can i nominate my player yet?
[17:02] <@jpnance> yeah, everybody's here
[17:02] <Jeffaray> because I'm going to run out of power and have to leave Friday's
[17:02] <Schex> then call me again
[17:02] <Schex> and do it over the phone
[17:02] <syed> or go to starbucks
[17:02] <@jpnance> we can stop officially whenever you guys sound like you want to
[17:02] <@jpnance> but if we do that, we'll probably have a day 3
[17:02] <daniel> officially start... NOW
[17:02] <@jpnance> that's all i'm saying
[17:02] <ks1> sweet, can trevor start the bidding
[17:03] <trevor> Julius Jones $1
[17:03] <james_r> for the sake of consistency, you shoudl have a hard and fast rule about when we stop, if you say anyone who leaves has to stop drafting altogether
03[17:03] * jpnance sets mode: +m
[17:03] <@jpnance> alright then
[17:03] <@jpnance> at 8pm PT (three-ish hours from now), we'll see where everybody stands
[17:03] <@jpnance> we're drafting until then, though
03[17:03] * jpnance sets mode: -m
[17:03] <@jpnance> sound reasonable?
[17:03] <Jeffaray> yeah
