PSO Seeding Architecture
=========================

This document provides an overview of the database seeding system for the PSO
fantasy football application. It's intended to help orient developers who need
to understand, debug, or refactor the seeding process.


NEW: CONSTRAINT-BASED DATA RECONSTRUCTION
-----------------------------------------

A new architecture has been implemented that separates facts from inference:

  data/facts/         - Parsers that extract raw facts (no interpretation)
  data/inference/     - Constraint checking and inference engine

Run the pipeline to analyze data quality:

  ./runts/inference-pipeline --local      # Quick local analysis
  ./runts/inference-pipeline              # Full analysis (requires network)

Run all tests:

  node tests/run-all.js

Key modules:
  - data/facts/trade-facts.js     - Parse WordPress trade posts
  - data/facts/snapshot-facts.js  - Parse contracts-YEAR.txt files
  - data/facts/sleeper-facts.js   - Parse Sleeper transaction JSON
  - data/facts/fantrax-facts.js   - Parse Fantrax data (2020-2021)
  - data/inference/constraints.js - Constraint validation
  - data/inference/contract-term.js - Contract term inference with confidence
  - data/inference/ambiguity.js   - Ambiguity tracking and resolution

See data/facts/README.md and the plan document for architecture details.


OVERVIEW
--------

The seeding system populates the database with historical data from multiple
sources spanning 2008-present. The main orchestration script is:

    data/maintenance/reset-migration.sh

This script drops migration collections and runs seeders in a specific order.


DATA SOURCES
------------

1. Sleeper API (players, current rosters)
   - Fetched by: runts/sleeper
   - Stored in: public/data/sleeper-data.json
   - Contains: player metadata, ESPN IDs, rookie years, positions

2. WordPress API (trades)
   - Fetched by: data/seed/trades.js
   - Source: thedynastyleague.wordpress.com
   - Contains: trade posts with player contracts, cash, picks

3. Google Sheets (cuts, current contracts)
   - Fetched by: data/seed/cuts.js, data/seed/contracts.js
   - Contains: spreadsheet snapshots of roster/contract data

4. Local archive files (historical contracts, auctions)
   - Location: data/archive/
   - Files: contracts-YEAR.txt (2008-2025), auction logs, dynasty XML
   - Processed by: data/seed/auction.js

5. Fixups and resolutions (manual corrections)
   - data/config/fixups.json - trade amendments, player corrections
   - data/config/player-resolutions.json - player name disambiguation cache
   - data/config/sleeper-fixups-YEAR.json - Sleeper import corrections


SEEDING ORDER (from reset-migration.sh)
---------------------------------------

Step 0:  Sleeper data fetch (if stale)
Step 1:  league-config.js      - League configuration
Step 2:  entities.js           - Franchises, people, regimes
Step 3:  sync-players.js       - Create Player documents from Sleeper data
Step 4:  contracts.js          - Current year contracts (Google Sheets)
Step 5:  picks.js              - Draft pick ownership
Step 6:  draft-selections.js   - Historical draft picks (Google Sheets)
Step 7:  trades.js             - All trades (WordPress API)
Step 8:  cuts.js               - All cuts (Google Sheets)
Step 9:  budgets.js            - Calculate budget impacts from transactions
Step 10: apply-fixups.js       - Apply manual corrections from fixups.json
Step 11: seasons.js            - Compute playoff seeds and results
Step 12: auction.js            - Historical contracts (per-year, 2008-2025)


KEY COMPONENTS
--------------

Player Resolution (data/utils/player-resolver.js)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Central utility for matching player names to Player documents. Features:
- Name normalization (strips suffixes like Jr., III, parenthetical hints)
- Candidate filtering by position and rookie year plausibility
- Interactive prompts for ambiguous names
- Resolution caching in player-resolutions.json
- Historical player creation for players not in Sleeper

Key concepts:
- "Historical player": A Player document with sleeperId: null
- "Context": Year, type (trade/draft/auction/cut), franchise
- "_ambiguous" list: Names that always require manual disambiguation
- rookieYear vs estimatedRookieYear: Reliable vs calculated values

Contract Parsing (data/seed/trades.js: parseContract)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Parses contract strings like "2009", "09/11", "2010-2012" from trade posts.
Uses heuristics based on trade date to infer startYear when only endYear given.

Rookie Contract Heuristic (data/seed/trades.js)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For players drafted in our league, attempts to infer that a single-year
contract string refers to a rookie deal (startYear = draftYear).


KNOWN ISSUES / TECHNICAL DEBT
-----------------------------

1. Fixups can override correct parsing
   - apply-fixups.js runs late and may contain stale corrections
   - Example: Austin Collie Trade #13 had a fixup setting 2010-2010, but
     that was an impossible contract given that trade's timestamp
   - Need to audit tradeContractCorrections in fixups.json

2. Auction.js runs last but creates historical data
   - Other seeders (trades, cuts) may have already tried to infer contracts
   - Ordering creates potential for duplicate or conflicting data

3. Multiple places store corrections
   - fixups.json (trade/player corrections)
   - player-resolutions.json (name disambiguation)
   - contracts-YEAR.txt files (manually edited)
   - sleeper-fixups-YEAR.json files
   - Unclear when to use which

4. Inference heuristics are scattered
   - trades.js: parseContract(), rookie contract heuristic
   - cuts.js: contract inference
   - auction.js: contract parsing, ESPN ID matching
   - player-resolver.js: candidate filtering

5. Historical data quality varies
   - 2008-2011: Sparse, reconstructed from auction logs and XML snapshots
   - 2012-2019: Better coverage from spreadsheets
   - 2020+: Complete data from Sleeper/Fantrax


SEEDER SCRIPTS SUMMARY
----------------------

  contracts, picks, cash. Creates trade Transaction documents. Has
  parseContract() for interpreting contract strings and a rookie contract
  heuristic.

  when available, falls back to player-resolver.


COMMAND-LINE FLAGS
------------------

--dry-run
  Most seeders support this. Prevents database writes.

--auto-historical-before=YEAR
  Used by draft-selections.js. Auto-creates historical players for
  drafts before the specified year when no Sleeper match exists.

--auto-historical
  Used by auction.js. Auto-creates historical players when no match found.

--skip-ambiguous
  Skips players that would require interactive disambiguation.

--clear
  Some seeders support this to clear existing data before seeding.


USEFUL QUERIES
--------------

# Check for duplicate transactions
db.transactions.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: { type: "$type", playerId: "$playerId", startYear: "$startYear" }, count: { $sum: 1 } } },
  { $match: { count: { $gt: 1 } } }
])

# Find transactions for a player
db.transactions.find({ playerId: ObjectId("...") }).sort({ timestamp: 1 })

# Check a specific trade
db.transactions.findOne({ type: "trade", tradeId: 13 })


FILES OF INTEREST
-----------------
