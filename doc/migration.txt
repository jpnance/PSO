Spreadsheet Migration Steps
===========================

1. Seed franchises, people, regimes:
   docker compose run --rm web node data/scripts/seedEntities.js --clear

2. Seed players from Sleeper:
   docker compose run --rm web node data/scripts/seedPlayers.js --clear

3. Seed contracts from spreadsheet (interactive - prompts for ambiguous player matches):
   docker compose run --rm -it web node data/scripts/seedContracts.js --clear

4. Seed budgets from spreadsheet:
   docker compose run --rm web node data/scripts/seedBudgets.js --clear

5. Seed picks from spreadsheet:
   docker compose run --rm web node data/scripts/seedPicks.js --clear

6. TODO: Import trade history from trade-history.json


Future Work
-----------
- 2012 Expansion Draft: The league expanded from 10 to 12 franchises in 2012.
  Quinn and Mitch joined via an expansion draft where they selected existing
  players under contract and RFA rights. This data exists in the "Past Drafts"
  spreadsheet ("2012 Expansion" tab) but isn't imported by seedPicks.js since
  it's not a standard rookie draft. Consider preserving as static history.
