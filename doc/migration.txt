Spreadsheet Migration Steps
===========================

1. Seed franchises, people, regimes:
   docker compose run --rm web node data/scripts/seedEntities.js --clear

2. Seed players from Sleeper:
   docker compose run --rm web node data/scripts/seedPlayers.js --clear

3. Seed contracts from spreadsheet (interactive - prompts for ambiguous player matches):
   docker compose run --rm -it web node data/scripts/seedContracts.js --clear

4. Seed budgets from spreadsheet:
   docker compose run --rm web node data/scripts/seedBudgets.js --clear

5. Seed picks from spreadsheet:
   docker compose run --rm web node data/scripts/seedPicks.js --clear

6. Parse trade history from WordPress (regenerates trade-history.json):
   node data/scripts/parseTradeHistory.js
   
   (Can also run in docker if needed, but requires network access)

7. Import trade history (interactive - prompts for ambiguous player matches):
   docker compose run --rm -it web node data/scripts/seedTrades.js --clear

8. Parse draft selections (generates draft-selections.json for review):
   node data/scripts/parseDraftSelections.js
   
   Review draft-selections.json and fill in sleeperId for unmatched players.
   Set sleeperId to "historical" for players not in Sleeper data.

9. Import draft selections:
   docker compose run --rm web node data/scripts/seedDraftSelections.js --clear


Future Work
-----------
- 2012 Expansion Draft: The league expanded from 10 to 12 franchises in 2012.
  Quinn and Mitch joined via an expansion draft where they selected existing
  players under contract and RFA rights. This data exists in the "Past Drafts"
  spreadsheet ("2012 Expansion" tab) but isn't imported by seedPicks.js since
  it's not a standard rookie draft. Consider preserving as static history.

- Cuts history: The "Cuts" tab has 3,500+ historical player cuts with buyout
  amounts. Would require fuzzy player matching similar to draft selections.
  Creates fa-cut transactions for complete transaction history.

- Historical spreadsheet snapshots: Google Sheets revision history could be
  downloaded via Drive API and parsed to reconstruct historical state at
  specific points in time. Complex and may not be worth the effort.


- Fix trades #600 and #688: Cash was entered into the wrong year in the
  spreadsheet. Need to update these trades in the database to match the
  spreadsheet (which is canonical), and add notes explaining the discrepancy.
