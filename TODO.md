  - [ ] Trade Machine: Don't show "Propose Trade" button during dead period (or disable with explanation)
  - [ ] Trade Machine: Remove notes field (admin-only)
  - [ ] Proposal page: Add drafts to 7-day cleanup (removes need for Delete button)
  - [ ] Proposal page: Change copy to "This hypothetical trade hasn't been officially proposed."
