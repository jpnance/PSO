* Discussion Topic: 2023 Retrospective: 12th through 9th
   * Patrick takes Quinn
      * 12th place, 3-12, 46-119
      * What worked out
         * His own players
            * Bijan Robinson ($25, 23/25) delivers as much as Arthur Smith let him
               * #12 RB
               * Hopefully Arthur Smith either goes away or decides to stop giving the #8 overall pick in the NFL Draft this arbitrary rookie treatment
            * CeeDee Lamb ($195, 23/25) was a contract that a bunch of us weren't too sure about but he's really delivered
               * #2 WR
               * Just three games in single digits all season
            * Courtland Sutton ($15, 23/25) is the most boring ten touchdown scorer of all-time, right?
               * But he worked out! It works out when you spend fifteen bucks and get the #17 WR
         * Trades
            * Kyren Williams ($6, 23/25) nets a first round pick and $50 next year
               * #4 RB at time of writing, though it's not clear to me if that includes or excludes his time missed in the middle of the season
            * Saquon Barkley ($245, 21/23) was good enough in the first couple of weeks to net Quinn a couple of second rounders next year
            * Stefon Diggs ($180, 23/24) was good enough to net quinn a first rounder next year and $110 spread across the next couple of years
      * What didn't
         * Geno Smith ($160, 23/25) just didn't do it
            * $160 is too much to pay for the #18 QB
            * The Seahawks don't necessarily have a serious replacement already on the roster but guys like Kirk Cousins, Baker Mayfield, Ryan Tannehill, and even Gardner Minshew are gonna be free agents
            * Certainly going to be a cut candidate in August
         * Desmond Ridder ($19, 22/24) was acquired in a preseason trade
            * Only ends up as the #22 QB
            * Even gets benched for a period midseason
         * Dollar-wise, Geno Smith is really the only contract that didn't work out because almost every other guy we haven't already mentioned makes $10 or less
         * Maybe the bigger way to look at this is that Quinn's low-dollar gambles just didn't really hit: Hunter Renfrow ($2), Zay Jones ($4), Michael Carter ($3), Nyheim Hines ($1), Darius Slayton ($3)
      * What Quinn has to look forward to in 2024
         * One first-rounder: #8 overall
         * Three second-rounders: #17, #20, and wherever Mike ends up
         * $598 available now, add another $100 or so if he ends up cutting Geno
         * It's a decent amount of money to work with but this team has a lot of needs, predominantly starting with quarterback
   * Patrick takes James/Charles
      * 11th place, 4-11, 53-112
      * What worked out
         * Jordan Love ($130, 23/24) ends our regular season only hitting single digits twice
            * #8 QB, which is a pretty solid value for $130
         * Deebo Samuel ($63, 23/25) has gotta be one of the best contracts
            * Again, I'm not certain how we're counting his missed games here but Sleeper has him as the #6 WR
            * Been on an absolute tear to close the season
         * Will Levis ($15, 23/25) doesn't exactly have great numbers but you do love that you converted a rookie project into what appears to be a starting quarterback going forward in year one
         * Keenan Allen ($65, 23/23) got converted into a couple of bit players, a second rounder, and $100 next year
         * You were able to turn two free agent defenders into a third rounder and $45 next year
      * What didn't
         * Aaron Jones ($100, 23/23) just didn't play enough this year
            * Opened the season with 24.70 points but got hurt and would go on to miss six games scattered across the season
            * Besides that, only one decent game besides the opener
         * Alexander Mattison ($40, 22/24) isn't like a huge bust, necessarily, but we certainly had higher hopes than the #33 RB coming into the season
         * Jimmy Garoppolo ($50, 23/23) was a combination of bad and hurt but you turned the absolute nothing contract into $5 next year, at least
      * What James/Charles have to look forward to in 2024
         * Four first-rounders: #2, #7, and two bottom-four picks
         * One second-rounder: #19 overall
         * $652 available going into next season with a few decent cut candidates who would return some cash
         * Running back would appear to be the biggest hole so I'd certainly expect that to be your focus in the draft
   * Charles takes Jason
      * 10th place, 5-10, 69-96
   * Charles takes Luke
      * 9th place, 6-9, 59-106


* The Decision
   * Koci/Mueller Decide that Mike is their best matchup for the semifinal
   * Koci/Mueller all season vs.
      * Justin: 8-7
      * Mike: 7-8
      * Mitch: 9-6
   * Koci/Mueller last four weeks vs.
      * Justin: 2-2
      * Mike: 2-2
      * Mitch: 3-1
   * So, Charles, help me and everyone else understand what Koci/Mueller are looking at here.
   * Note from the League Historian
      * KoMu are making their second Decision. Two of the previous four teams making their second Decision have won the title


      * After the first nine Deciders went 3-6 in the semis with an unbelievable 6-21 all-play, the last four Deciders have won their semis and gone 10-2 in AP.


      * Despite that recent success, the last three Deciders have fallen in the title game.


      * Luke's loss last year was the first time in league history that a Decider had a possible title path but Decided incorrectly. I really can't believe Keyon wasn't the one to break that streak


* Game Previews and Risky Player Options for the Semifinals
   * Here are some facts
      * The four playoff teams have the four best all-play records in the league
      * The playoff field collectively have the lowest all-play percentage since 2012 (although only slightly lower than 2016 and 2019, so it's not like we've never seen fields like this)
      * Koci/Mueller have the best all-play record at 114-51 (.691)
         * That's the third-worst best all-play record in our history:
            * 2008 Schexes: 85-41 (.675)
            * 2009 Schexes at 87-39 (.690)
         * Those are the only best all-play teams who have failed to win 70% of their all-play games
      * Ultimately, I guess I'm suggesting that this is a pretty flat field this year and truly any of these four teams could win it all
   * #1 Koci/Mueller (11-4, 114-51) vs. #3 Mike (10-5, 103-62)
      * Koci/Mueller playoff context
         * This is Koci/Mueller's eighth playoff appearance and first since 2019
         * That three-year gap is the longest playoff drought in their history
         * Koci/Mueller are 9-5 in the playoffs all-time: 1st place finishes in 2009, 2010, and 2018, 2nd place finishes in 2012, 2014, and 2019, and one 4th place finish in 2015
         * If you were listening closely, you'll have noticed that Koci/Mueller have only lost in the semifinals once in their seven trips to the playoffs
      * Mike playoff context
         * This is, of course, Mike's first playoff appearance as a solo owner
         * Mike joins Jason as the only post-2008 new owners to make the playoffs
         * Obviously, we have no real stats on Mike, other than his co-ownership season with Mitch last year
         * This franchise, though, split between Mike and Trevor, is making its seventh playoff appearance and is 4-8 in the playoffs all-time: one 1st place finish in 2012, two 3rd place finishes in 2013 and 2020, and three 4th place finishes in 2008, 2011, and 2016
         * If you were listening closely, you'll have noticed that Mike's franchise has only ever won in the semifinals once in its six trips to the playoffs
      * Charles takes Koci/Mueller: Hall
      * Patrick takes Mike
         * Mike sent in a three-fer but we're really only set up for two options here in the RPO universe (we're not *that* multi of a multiverse)
         * The three-fer was Saquon Barkley, Josh Jacobs, and Isaiah Pacheco
         * I took a look at ESPN's composite rankings and, apparently, they like Barkley the most of those three, so we're gonna make the RPO the other two
         * Josh Jacobs or Isaiah Pacheco
            * Mike kinda lucks out here because both of these guys have injury concerns but they're playing each and, critically, they're both playing before Saquon Barkley does
            * Jacobs
               * Only had two rushing performances over 100 yards this year although they've both come recently and there was a 98-yard day in there as well
               * He's coming off a quad injury that kept him out of the game in Week 15 but the coach said he's figuring on playing him
               * He certainly hasn't been at the level he was last year but he still gets a ton of work in this offense and has been totally viable
               * At the Chiefs (14th)
            * Pacheco
               * Two most recent games have been monsters: 20.9 and 18.3 points
               * 15 or more carries in both, one or more touchdowns in both; it's been great
               * One caveat: those two most recent games were in Weeks 12 and 13; he's missed two games with a shoulder injury since then
               * His coach says he's good to go as well, though, and you like that matchup just fine
               * Hosting the Raiders (22nd)
      * The Decider is 7-6 in the semifinals
      * The Simulator has Koci/Mueller winning this one 59% of the time
      * Pat projection: Koci/Mueller
      * Charles prediction
   * #2 Justin (10-5, 107-58) vs. #4 Mitch (10-5, 103-62)
      * Justin playoff context
         * This is Justin's first playoff appearance
         * Needing at least a year or two to make the playoffs for the first time is certainly a much more common route in this league
         * We have no playoffs stats whatsoever on Justin himself
         * This franchise, though, split between Justin and John, is making its fourth playoff appearances and is 4-2 in the playoffs: one 1st place finish in 2020, one 2nd place finish in 2016, and one 3rd place finish in 2010
      * Mitch playoff context
         * This is Mitch's sixth playoff appearance and, of course, he's the defending champion
         * Mitch is 7-3 in the playoffs all-time: three 1st place finishes in 2013, 2014, and 2022, one 2nd place finish in 2015, and one 4th place finish in 2018
         * Just like Koci/Mueller, that means that Mitch has only ever lost one semifinal game in his five previous trips to the playoffs
      * Patrick takes Justin
         * Flip a couple things around and this is possible
         * Austin Ekeler or Jaylen Waddle
            * Ekeler
               * Four out of his last five games have been bad, like 5-points-or-less bad
               * 64 yards is his best rushing total in that span and, in fact, his third best on the season
               * With the exception of Week 1, when you dive into Ekeler's numbers, he sure looks like a touchdown-dependent guy
               * The work he gets in the passing game is truly the only thing he has going for him because his rushing numbers are lousy
               * Hosting the Bills (17th)
            * Waddle
               * Been decent this year but exploded with Tyreek Hill out of the lineup last week: 8 catches on 9 targets for 142 yards and a touchdown
               * Lest we think Hill's absence is entirely why that happened, I will note that Waddle's been north of 100 yards on two other occasions this year
               * It is, however, a tough matchup
               * Hosting the Cowboys (6th)
      * Charles takes Mitch: Mullens
      * The Simulator has Mitch winning this one 51% of the time
      * Pat projection: Mitch
      * Charles prediction
