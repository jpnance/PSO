* Game Previews and Risky Player Options for Week 7
   * The Simulator will make its traditional post-Week-7 return next week!
   * Justin (4-2) vs. Mike (5-1)
      * New H2H series
      * Charles takes Justin
      * Patrick takes Mike
         * Just nothing interesting at all here so…
         * Aidan Hutchinson or Chris Jones
            * Hutchinson
               * 4.5 sacks, 1 FF, 1 FR, and 1 INT on the season
               * Doesn't get many tackles, of course, but has definitely found himself involved in some big plays
               * At the Ravens (Lamar Jackson)
            * Jones
               * 5.5 sacks and at least one sack in every game he's played so far this season
               * No FFs, FRs, or INTs yet; tackles also kinda low
               * Hosting the Chargers (Justin Herbert)
      * Pat projection: Justin
      * Charles prediction
   * Keyon (4-2) vs. Mitch (4-2)
      * Keyon leads the all-time regular season series 10-4 but Mitch won the most recent of those meetings as well as their semifinal game last season
      * Charles takes Keyon
      * Patrick takes Mitch
         * Tutu Atwell or DeVonta Smith
            * Atwell
               * Although he's had a decent season overall, he's coming off a 1 catch (1 target) for 30 yard performance
               * He was still on the field a ton, though, so you like that
               * Hosting the Steelers (29th)
            * Smith
               * Also coming off a lousy game but had better volume: 5 catches on 11 targets for 44 yards
               * Injury situation: Tweaked his hamstring, returned to practice, but the Eagles have Sunday Night Football so Mitch might have to make a call here
               * Hosting the Dolphins (21st)
      * Pat projection: Mitch
      * Charles prediction
   * Brett (2-4) vs. Schex (5-1)
      * Schex leads the all-time series 5-0, currently the only series more lopsided than 3-0
      * Charles takes Brett
      * Patrick takes Schex
         * This is kind of a mess right now
         * Roschon Johnson or Zack Moss
            * Johnson
               * Khalil Herbert is on IR so Roschon Johnson is the presumed starting RB in Chicago, but…
               * He's dealing with a concussion he suffered a couple weeks ago, so he's still trying to get back on the field
               * The little data we've got on him suggests that he could be an efficient RB assuming he's able to go
               * Hosting the Raiders (22nd)
            * Moss
               * Ick
               * It feels like you could just as easily put Jonathan Taylor in this spot but I guess I'm gonna go with Moss
               * I won't belabor the point: Zack Moss has been really good, including last week, we just don't know how committed the Colts are to him after giving Taylor a ton of money
               * The stats look good although more troubling is that he took a huge dive in snap percentage last week with only 50%
               * Hosting the Browns (7th)
      * Pat projection: Schex
      * Charles prediction
   * Patrick (3-3) vs. Luke (2-4)
      * JAGUAR GAME
      * Luke leads the all-time series 11-9, has won the last three meetings and seven of the last eight
      * Patrick takes Patrick
         * *sigh*
         * Daniel Jones or Baker Mayfield
            * Jones
               * Been really bad this year except for one half against the Cardinals
               * Missed last week with a neck injury
               * He's been limited in practice this week, so we'll see if he gets back out there
               * And, see, the matchup's the thing
               * Hosting the Commanders (30th)
            * Mayfield
               * Been pretty reasonable this year
               * Coming off a lousy game: 19/37, 206 yards, 0 TD, 1 INT
               * Only taken five sacks on the season (for reference, Daniel Jones has taken at least five sacks in three different games)
               * Matchup's not quite as good
               * Hosting the Falcons (18th)
      * Charles takes Luke
      * Pat projection: Patrick
      * Charles prediction
   * Koci/Mueller (3-3) vs. Quinn (1-5)
      * Koci/Mueller lead the all-time series 10-1 and have won the last nine meetings
      * Charles takes Koci/Mueller
      * Patrick takes Quinn
         * Tyson Bagent or Desmond Ridder
            * Bagent
               * Justin Fields got hurt last week so something called Tyson Bagent is who's next in line in Chicago
               * He's a rookie who played ball at a college called "Shepherd", which Sleeper seems to think is in West Virginia
               * He threw an interception last week and lost a fumble, but also scored a rushing touchdown
               * Hosting the Raiders (14th)
            * Ridder
               * Last week against the Commanders, Ridder threw three interceptions and took three sacks and, despite that, had his third best game of the season, thanks to a couple of touchdowns and 300 passing yards
               * It's been rough for this guy so far but he's put together two straight acceptable (or better) fantasy games, so maybe he's turning it around
               * At the Buccaneers (12th)
      * Pat projection: Koci/Mueller
      * Charles prediction
   * Jason (1-5) vs. James/Charles (2-4)
      * James/Charles lead the all-time series 2-1 but Jason won the most recent meeting
      * Patrick takes Jason
         * Brutal bye week for Jason and, to tell you the truth, I didn't have the patience to actually reason through everything, so I just went with the first decent thing I saw, which was:
         * Minkah Fitzpatrick or Jevon Holland
            * Fitzpatrick
               * Lousy game to open the season but between 8 and 9 points in his four games since
               * No big plays to his name this year, though, so he's more of a tackles and passes defensed guy
               * He's putting up good numbers and you like to see it
               * At the Rams (Matthew Stafford)
            * Holland
               * He started the season with three games that were all better than Fitzpatrick's best game to date
               * He's since scored point totals that are worse than all but Fitzpatrick's opening day dud
               * Still on the field a good amount, though, and still certainly capable of getting tackles
               * At the Eagles (Jalen Hurts)
      * Charles takes James/Charles
      * Pat projection: James/Charles
      * Charles prediction


* High Scorer's Corner: Justin
   * APPLAUSE
   * Justin scored 169.82
   * 3rd scoring title this season
   * 4th scoring title all-time (T-13th overall)
