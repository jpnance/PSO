   * Trade #578


* Game Previews and Risky Player Options for Week 6
   * Justin (3-2) vs. Mitch (4-1)
      * Mitch has won both all-time meetings
      * Charles takes Justin
      * Patrick takes Mitch
         * Tutu Atwell or DeVonta Smith
            * Atwell
               * 24 catches on 40 targets for 279 yards and two touchdowns
               * Most recently, Kupp made it back and Tutu only had two catches on five targets for 9 yards and a touchdown
               * Van Jefferson no longer a Ram; traded to the Falcons mid-week
               * Hosting the Cardinals (25th)
            * Smith
               * I think it's easy to forget just how slow Smith started off the season last year; he was in a bunch of RPOs!
               * He really came on in Week 13 and was a must-start the rest of the way
               * Well, he got off the a quick start this year, scoring 30 points across his first two games but hasn't been north of 7.80 since and is mostly recently coming off a one-catch five-target six-yard no-touchdown performance
               * Tough matchup, too
               * At the Jets (2nd)
      * Pat projection: Justin
      * Charles prediction
   * Luke (2-3) vs. Schex (4-1)
      * JAGUAR GAME
      * Schex leads the all-time series 11-8 but Luke won the most recent meeting
      * Charles takes Luke
      * Patrick takes Schex
         * Rashid Shaheed or Jonathan Taylor
            * Shaheed
               * Saints WR who's on the field a fair amount but also returns kicks
               * His worst game of the season is 5.90 and he's been in double-digits for three of the other four
               * At the Texans (3rd)
            * Taylor
               * Ick, what on Earth do you say about this guy?
               * Made it into his first game last week but left a lot to be desired: six carries for just eighteen yards.
               * He was only on the field 15% of the time so maybe they were just easing him back but it's worth noting that Zack Moss has been really great in his stead
               * Also a tough matchup
               * At the Jaguars (6th)
      * Pat projection: Schex
      * Charles prediction
   * Mike (4-1) vs. James/Charles (2-3)
      * New H2H series
      * Patrick takes Mike
         * Joe Burrow or Sam Howell
            * Burrow
               * I'm sure you're well aware of Burrow's stats this year
               * Been really up and down: had a good Week 2 and a good Week 5 but has been pretty lousy otherwise
               * He's not taking a ton of sacks or throwing that many interceptions, though, it's just that the yardage and touchdowns have been down so far
               * Decent matchup
               * Hosting the Seahawks (21st)
            * Howell
               * Three good games to go along with one decent one; only had one dreadful game (the notorious -8.40 performance)
               * Perhaps more critically, he's outscored Joe Burrow four of the five weeks this year (although he only outscored him by one passing yard this past week)
               * At the Falcons (15th)
      * Charles takes James/Charles
      * Pat projection: Mike
      * Charles prediction
   * Koci/Mueller (2-3) vs. Brett (2-3)
      * Brett leads the all-time series 3-2 but every result in this series has alternated and Brett won the most recent meeting
      * Charles takes Koci/Mueller
      * Patrick takes Brett
         * Terry McLaurin or Tank Dell
            * McLaurin
               * It's not like he's been bad, exactly
               * 25 catches on 31 targets for 261 yards and a touchdown
               * You just kinda wish he was getting thrown to more
               * He's definitely Sam Howell's favorite target, Howell just spreads it around a lot
               * Hosting the Bears (24th)
            * Dell
               * 19 catches on 28 targets for 324 yards and two touchdowns
               * He's significantly outpacing McLaurin in production despite lagging him in volume
               * Dell is dealing with a concussion but both he and McLaurin play at the same time, so you'll have injury protection
               * At the Falcons (6th)
      * Pat projection: Koci/Mueller
      * Charles prediction
   * Keyon (3-2) vs. Quinn (1-4)
      * Keyon leads the all-time series 7-5 and has won each of the last four meetings
      * Patrick takes Keyon
         * This is really just the only interesting decision on Keyon's roster
         * Mac Jones or Bryce Young
            * Jones
               * You'll be happy to hear that Mac Jones has "been confirmed as the Week 6 starter" for the Patriots
               * He's coming off two straight games in negative land, throwing zero touchdowns, two interceptions, and losing one fumble in both of them
               * It's been bad!
               * At the Raiders (20th)
            * Young
               * Had his first really nice game as a pro last week: 25/41 for 247 yards and 3 touchdowns
               * He did throw a couple of interceptions but only took one sack, which all came out to a 17-point day
               * The main question is just how much you're buying it
               * At the Dolphins (26th)
      * Charles takes Quinn
      * Pat projection: Keyon
      * Charles prediction
   * Patrick (2-3) vs. Jason (1-4)
      * Jason has won both all-time meetings
      * Patrick takes Patrick
         * Sorry, this is just really all there is on my roster; if Adam Thielen weren't the #10 WR it might be different but he is!
         * Mike Gesicki or Hayden Hurst
            * Gesicki
               * Been bad
               * At the Raiders (18th)
            * Hurst
               * Been somewhat less bad
               * At the Dolphins (21st)
      * Charles takes Jason
      * Pat projection: Patrick
      * Charles prediction


* High Scorer's Corner: Mike
   * APPLAUSE
   * Mike scored 174.56
   * 1st scoring title this season
   * 1st scoring title all-time (T-18th overall)
