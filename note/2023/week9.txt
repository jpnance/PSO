   * Rematch week!
      * Historically, we've had 195 sweeps to only 115 splits
      * There's only been one season when sweeps failed to outnumber splits: 2019 when they went 9 sweeps to 9 splits
      * Literally every other year, there are more sweeps than splits

               * Hosting the Commanders (21st)
            * Mayer
               * On the field a ton but his targets have been really variable
               * Hasn't outscored Henry since Week 5 but you've gotta be interested in the opportunity
               * Hosting the Giants (8th)
      * Mitch takes Mitch
      * Pat projection: Mitch
      * Mitch prediction

         * Brian Robinson or Jaren Hall
            * Robinson
               * Just the #9 running back who Justin doesn't tend to need so he rides his bench wearing his big hat
               * Doesn't really get as many carries as you'd like but he does a good job of finding the end zone
               * At the Patriots (11th)
            * Hall
               * Starting for the Vikings at quarterback this week
               * Rookie; 5th round pick out of BYU
               * In relief of Cousins last week, he got sacked and lost a fumble
               * Ended his day at -2.18

            * Dell
               * Got off to an awesome start this year but has slowed down
               * Still, he's involved in the offense to the tune of 3 or 4 targets a game and he also returns punts
               * You feel pretty good about his chances to put five points up there
               * Hosting the Buccaneers (26th)
            * Watson
               * On the field a bunch and gets decent targets (8 last week!) but hasn't really put together a great game yet this season
               * Yet to score in double-digits, and that despite scoring a touchdown earlier this season
               * Hosting the Rams (9th)

         * Jonnu Smith or Hayden Hurst
            * Smith
               * Been pretty decent this year but the targets have taken a dip the last couple weeks
               * Only four combined targets in his last two games after seeing at least five targets in five straight games
               * Taylor Heinicke gets the start this week (who knows)
               * Hosting the Vikings (13th)
            * Hurst
               * Scored a touchdown in Week 1 and ended up at 10.10 points

      * Jason leads the all-time series 3-0 and, of course, won in Week 1
      * Mitch takes Koci/Mueller
      * Patrick takes Jason
         * Chuba Hubbard or Ezekiel Elliott
            * Hubbard
               * Been getting a bunch of carries the last few weeks but hasn't done hardly anything with them
               * Last week: 15 carries for just 28 yards
               * Hosting the Colts (28th)
            * Elliott
               * Gets reasonable carries, but obviously nothing like he used to for the Cowboys
               * That said, he scored a rushing touchdown in Weeks 6 and 7, and he averaged over five yards per carry (seven carries) last week
               * Hosting the Commanders (13th)
      * Pat projection: Koci/Mueller
      * Mitch prediction

      * Patrick takes Quinn
         * Taylor Heinicke or Tyson Bagent
            * Heinicke
               * Scored 11.40 in relief of Desmond Ridder last week, only playing half the game
               * He's shown in the past that he can be a decent option
               * It's also worth noting that rushing is part of his game
               * Hosting the Vikings (22nd)
            * Bagent
               * Even though he threw two interceptions last week against the Chargers, he still managed a double-digit performance, which makes him 2/2 scoring double-digits in his starts
               * He's scored a rushing touchdown in two of his three appearances
               * Only taken two sacks in his two starts, which you like
               * At the Saints (7th)
