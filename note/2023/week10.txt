* Game Previews and Risky Player Options for Week 10
   * Koci/Mueller (6-3, .811/.926/.618, 63%) vs. Mike (6-3, .691/.876/.581, 37%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.243
      * Decision interest level: 0.440
      * Both teams are looking to avoid what would be a significant playoff hunt setback and stay in the hunt for The Decision
      * New H2H series
      * Charles takes Koci/Mueller
      * Patrick takes Mike
         * Tyler Lockett or Jerry Jeudy
            * Lockett
               * Limited in practice on Wednesday but he's been on the injury report all season and hasn't missed a game
               * He's not great, though he does get a bunch of work still
               * Only two (three-ish) games in double-digits
               * Hosting the Commanders (30th)
            * Jeudy
               * Pretty consistent workload of six targets
               * Finally scored his first touchdown of the season last week so he's coming off his best game of the season
               * At the Bills (14th)
      * Pat projection: Mike
      * Charles prediction
   * Schex (6-3, .463/.649/.334, 41%) vs. Mitch (7-2, .852/.953/.706, 59%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.273
      * Decision interest level: 0.399
      * A win for Schex very much keeps him in the hunt for the playoffs
      * A win for Mitch just about cements his spot in the playoffs and keeps him in the hunt for The Decision
      * Schex leads the all-time series 9-4 and has won the last three matchups
      * Patrick takes Schex
         * Rashid Shaheed or Marquise Brown
            * Shaheed
               * In the offense a little bit: multiple catches in all but one game this season
               * Also gets KR/PR duties, so he has a decent scoring floor
               * 3.2 is his worst game of the year and he's been in double-digits five times
               * At the Vikings (22nd)
            * Brown
               * Very much in the offense but, really, for all the targets he gets, he barely gets any yardage
               * He only has one game where he even got close to 100 yards
               * He does, however, have four touchdowns and we expect Kyler Murray to be out there this week, not "Clayton Tune"
               * Hosting the Falcons (12th)
      * Charles takes Mitch
      * Pat projection: Schex
      * Charles prediction
   * Justin (7-2, .935/.982/.843, 66%) vs. Keyon (5-4, .204/.378/.117, 34%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.220
      * Decision interest level: 0.365
      * Justin's looking to inch ever close to The Decision
      * Keyon's looking to stay in the hunt for the playoffs
      * Keyon leads the all-time series 2-0
      * Patrick takes Justin
         * There's just nothing worth considering except IDPs
         * Bobby Okereke or Dre Greenlaw
            * Okereke
               * Really nice season: been in double-digits four times and almost a fifth
               * At the Cowboys (Dak Prescott)
            * Greenlaw
               * Two double-digit games of his own and two more that were close
               * At the Jaguars (Trevor Laurence)
      * Charles takes Keyon
      * Pat projection: Justin
      * Charles prediction
   * Brett (4-5, .024/.036/.005, 62%) vs. James/Charles (3-6, .000/.000/.000, 38%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.382
      * Decision interest level: 0.156
      * Both teams own their first round picks so this could be a big one in terms of draft-slotting
      * The all-time series is tied 2-2 and Brett won the recent meeting
      * Patrick takes Brett
         * Garrett Wilson or Tank Dell
            * Wilson
               * Absolute target machine: three straight games of 12 or 13 targets
               * No touchdowns in that span but he has racked up a good amount of yardage: 170 yards receiving
               * At the Raiders (7th)
            * Dell
               * Coming off a monster game in which he scored two touchdowns and racked up 116 receiving yards
               * Very much a boom-or-bust guy: no games between 7 and 13 points
               * At the Bengals (15th)
      * Charles takes James/Charles
      * Pat projection: Brett
      * Charles prediction
   * Luke (3-6, .002/.003/.000, 52%) vs. Jason (2-7, .000/.000/.000, 48%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.450
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * Luke must win to keep his very slim playoff hopes alive
      * Jason's just riding out the season now
      * The all-time series is tied 1-1 and Luke won the most recent meeting
      * Patrick takes Luke
         * I was getting totally lost trying to figure out Luke's lineup this week so I don't know how legit this is but it seems like one of these guys (maybe both?) is gonna get in there
         * Quentin Johnston or Wan'Dale Robinson
            * Johnston
               * His snap percentage has gone up lately: 70% or higher in both of his last two games
               * It hasn't necessarily shown up in production but he is getting thrown to at least a little bit
               * Hosting the Lions (13th)
            * Robinson
               * Coming off his best game of the year in which he scored a garbage time touchdown thrown by "Tommy DeVito"
               * It's otherwise been really quiet for Wan'Dale this year
               * At the Cowboys (6th)
      * Charles takes Jason
      * Pat projection: Luke
      * Charles prediction
   * Patrick (4-5, .017/.026/.004, 62%) vs. Quinn (1-8, .000/.000/.000, 38%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.124
      * Decision interest level: 0.155
      * Both teams own their first-round picks so they're both trying to win this one
      * Patrick takes Patrick
         * Davante Adams or Jakobi Meyers
            * Adams
               * Same old, same old
               * Plenty of looks but no production
               * His name is still Davante Adams (is it time for me to try and forget that?)
               * Hosting the Jets (1st)
            * Meyers
               * Same old, same old
               * Scoring a touchdown seemingly every week
               * Meyers was last outscored by Adams in Week 4 and in all but one of those weeks, Meyers has thoroughly outscored Adams
               * Hosting the Jets (1st)
      * Charles takes Quinn
      * Pat projection: Quinn
      * Charles prediction


* High Scorer's Corner: Patrick
   * APPLAUSE
   * Patrick scored 148.05
   * 1st scoring title this season
   * 19th scoring title all-time (4th overall)
   * Lowest score to capture a scoring title in the OPen era

   * Well it ain't no use to hit up my DMs, babe
I like this other offer more
And it ain't no use to hit up my DMs, babe
This guy's got a higher floor

Don't have any interest in Taylor Heinicke
I need someone with job security
Yes, Joshua Dobbs is the quarterback for me

So don't hit send, press delete

Well it ain't no use in a-sendin' in that trade, babe
For the picks and the cash
And it ain't no use in a-sendin' in that trade, babe
The deadline has passed

I know Charles got five bucks for Jimmy G.
And, yes, Derek Carr had some value to me
But our talks were never all that close, can't you see?

So don't hit send, press delete
