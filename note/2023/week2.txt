* Game Previews and Risky Player Options for Week 2
   * Sorted in terms of wins, ties are broken by points
   * Jason (1-0) vs. Mitch (1-0)
      * Jason looking to start 2-0 for the second time in his first three years in the league
      * Mitch looking to start 2-0 for the first time since 2018
      * Mitch leads the all-time series 3-0
      * Patrick takes Jason
         * Ezekiel Elliott or Van Jefferson
            * Elliott
               * Twelve touches split across seven carries and five receptions (seven targets!) but didn't do a ton with any of it
               * Also lost a fumble, which hurts
               * We will note, however, that Zeke's 29 rushing yards led the team in that category
               * Hosting the Dolphins (32nd)
            * Jefferson
               * Four catches on five targets for just 24 yards in Week 1 against the Seahawks
               * Tutu Atwell was easily the best receiver for the Rams in that game
               * Perhaps it'll get better?
               * Hosting the 49ers (15th)
      * Charles takes Mitch
      * Pat projection: Mitch
      * Charles prediction
   * Mike (1-0) vs. Keyon (1-0)
      * Mike looking for the franchise's first 2-0 start since 2020
      * Keyon looking for his first 2-0 start since 2020
      * New H2H series
      * Patrick takes Mike
         * Drake London or Rashod Bateman
            * London
               * 90% snap percentage in Week 1 but only one target and no receptions
               * Perhaps just a bump in the road
               * Hosting the Packers (13th)
            * Bateman
               * Caught all three of his targets for 35 yards in Week 1
               * Not really exciting at all but that, of course, beats London
               * None of the other Ravens receivers did a ton either
               * At the Bengals (5th)
      * Charles takes Keyon
      * Pat projection: Mike
      * Charles prediction
   * Luke (0-1) vs. Justin (1-0)
      * Luke looking to avoid his third 0-2 start in four years
      * Justin looking for his first 2-0 start ever
      * Luke won the only meeting of this series last season
      * Charles takes Luke
      * Patrick takes Justin
         * Kurt vs. Goff is the real weekly decision Justin has to make with this team but Kurt's playing tonight
         * Elijah Moore or Jaylen Waddle
            * Moore
               * Three catches on seven targets for 43 yards in Week 1
               * Also added some yards on the ground and a solo tackle
               * Not eye-popping numbers but the Browns really hammered the run
               * At the Steelers (30th)
            * Waddle
               * Four catches on five targets for 78 yards in Week 1
               * Nothing you don't like, really; Justin has a lot of good players
               * At the Patriots (19th)
      * Pat projection: Justin
      * Charles prediction
   * Patrick (0-1) vs. James/Charles (1-0)
      * Patrick looking to avoid a second consecutive 0-2 start
      * James/Charles looking the franchise's first 2-0 start since 2015 (just James then)
      * James/Charles lead the all-time series 6-4 but Patrick won the most recent meeting last year
      * Patrick takes Patrick
         * Wide receivers are a mess already but this is a good one that I'll likely deal with all season
         * Rachaad White or James Cook
            * White
               * 17 carries but just 39 yards in Week 1
               * That said, as you can imagine, 17 carries easily led the team, so you like the usage
               * Hosting the Bears (30th)
            * Cook
               * 12 carries and four receptions on six targets for a grand total of 63 yards in Week 1
               * That easily beat both Damien Harris and Latavius Murray in touches
               * Hosting the Raiders (16th)
      * Charles takes James/Charles
      * Pat projection: Patrick
      * Charles prediction
   * Koci/Mueller (0-1) vs. Schex (0-1)
      * Koci/Mueller looking to avoid a third consecutive 0-2 start
      * Schex looking to avoid his first 0-2 start since 2020
      * Schex leads the all-time series 11-9 and has won the last four meetings
      * Charles takes Koci/Mueller
      * Patrick takes Schex
         * Zack Moss or DJ Moore
            * Moss
               * Missed Week 1 with an arm injury but appears on track to play in Week 2
               * Still no Jonathan Taylor and Deon Jackson certainly didn't impress
               * At the Texans (28th)
            * Moore
               * Targeted just twice in Week 1 but caught both of them for 25 yards
               * Just not a lot to go on but I know you're a DJ Moore guy
               * At the Buccaneers (28th)
      * Pat projection: Koci/Mueller
      * Charles prediction
   * Brett (0-1) vs. Quinn (0-1)
      * Brett looking to avoid his second 0-2 start in three years
      * Quinn looking to avoid his first 0-2 start since 2020
      * Brett leads the all-time series 3-1 but Quinn won the most recent meeting
      * Patrick takes Brett
         * C.J. Stroud or Ryan Tannehill
            * Stroud
               * I know sometimes you start a guy because you just kinda want to start him and I'm certain that Brett is gonna be starting Stroud here
               * That said, he threw no touchdowns (also no interceptions) for 242 yards, lost a fumble, and got sacked five times in Week 1
               * That all adds up to like 4.5 points, so not great
               * Hosting the Colts (25th)
            * Tannehill
               * Yeah, so, his numbers were even worse
               * Disaster line of 198 yards, no touchdowns, three interceptions, and three sacks
               * That said, we know the Saints have been tough on quarterbacks in recent years; perhaps he'll find better success against this week
               * Hosting the Chargers (32nd)
      * Charles takes Quinn
      * Pat projection: Brett
      * Charles prediction
