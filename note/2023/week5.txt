            * Lawrence
               * Been okay this year; really just one "bad" game in Week 2

      * New H2H series
      * Charles takes Mike

               * Hosting the Bengals (29th)
      * Pat projection: Mike
      * Charles prediction
   * Keyon (2-2) vs. James/Charles (2-2)
      * Keyon looking to avoid his first losing record after five weeks since 2019
      * James/Charles looking to avoid their first losing record after five weeks since 2020
      * Keyon leads the all-time series 7-3 and has won the three most recent meetings
      * Patrick takes Keyon
         * Mac Jones or Bryce Young
            * Jones
               * You never like when the news comes out that "Mac Jones will remain the starter"
               * Last week was really the first disaster week for him but we know what the Cowboys can do to people who aren't Joshua Dobbs
               * Hosting the Saints (16th)
            * Young
               * Has yet to score in double-digits this year
               * Just still looks like a rookie out there, not much else to say: too many turnovers and sacks

      * Charles takes James/Charles
      * Pat projection: Keyon

      * Patrick takes Koci/Mueller
         * Zach Wilson or Kenny Pickett
            * Wilson
               * Enjoyed the third-best fantasy game of his career last week against the Chiefs; 28/39 245 yards and 2 touchdowns, no interceptions
               * Amusing stat: He's only had one turnover-free game this year and it was his worst game so far
               * At the Broncos (32nd)
            * Pickett
               * Looked promising after Week 3 but laid a huge egg against the Texans: 15/23, 114 yards, 0 TD, 1 INT
               * He's been limited in practice but does expect to play
