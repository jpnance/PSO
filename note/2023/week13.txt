* Discussion Topic: Sub-100s
   * ARBITRARY CUTOFF ALERT: 100 points is a totally arbitrary number that has no real meaning other than that we all know the average score in this league is always well above 100
   * Keyon
      * 79.52 is his lowest score in the OPen Era and only his second time going below 100
      * Worst score since 2013-03; just over a decade!
         * There are only two streaks that are close to half that long
            * Schex's 89.40 in Week 9 this year snapped a six-year streak dating back to 2017-01
            * Patrick's 75.52 in 2018-09 snapped a five-year streak dating back to 2013-07
            * Koci/Mueller had one almost four years long; Quinn had one almost three years long
   * I had to dive deeper on this
   * Current owners' sub-100 scores
      * Brett: 6
      * James/Charles: 17
      * Jason: 1
      * Justin: 1
      * Keyon: 2
      * Koci/Mueller: 13
      * Luke: 21
      * Mike: 0
      * Mitch: 7
      * Patrick: 13
      * Quinn: 18
      * Schex: 6

* CHECK FOR JASON'S HSC


* Game Previews and Risky Player Options for Week 13
   * Koci/Mueller (8-4, .804/.931/.602, 61%) vs. Justin (9-3, .983/1.000/.972, 39%) 455
      * Playoff interest level: 0.146
      * Decision interest level: 0.309
      * Justin won the only regular season meeting between these two teams last year
      * Charles takes Koci/Mueller: Browning
      * Patrick takes Justin
         * Cade Otton or Elijah Moore
            * Otton
               * I'm amazed he's only the #15 TE because, for the most part, he puts up multiple (!) points each week
               * Scored at least four points in five of his last six games
               * Even scored two touchdowns in one of the games in that stretch
               * Hosting the Panthers (11th)
            * Moore
               * Just hasn't remotely delivered on the promise he showed a couple years ago
               * Only scored one touchdown all season; 60 yards receiving is his best yardage game
               * He's on the field a bunch, though: 62% is his worst snap percentage and there are lots of 70s and 80s
               * At the Rams (14th)
      * Pat projection: Koci/Mueller
      * Charles prediction
   * Keyon (6-6, .019/.043/.000, 42%) vs. Schex (7-5, .179/.265/.063, 58%) 444
      * JAGUAR GAME
      * Playoff interest level: 0.444
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * Keyon leads the all-time series 14-8 and has won four in a row and seven of the last eight
      * Patrick takes Keyon
         * Romeo Doubs or Drake London
            * Doubs
               * Talked about Doubs a bit last week
               * Seven touchdowns on the season, though he didn't find one last week
               * On the field a lot and Jordan Love sends about half a dozen passes his way each week
               * Hosting the Chiefs (8th)
            * London
               * More of an offensive focal point than Doubs, even if he doesn't get the end zone looks the way Doubs does
               * Seven or more targets in seven of his ten games this season
               * Tons of snap percentage points, too
               * At the Jets (1st)
      * Charles takes Schex: Engram
      * Pat projection: Keyon
      * Charles prediction
   * Brett (6-6, .027/.046/.002, 56%) vs. Jason (3-9, .000/.000/.000, 44%) 199
      * Playoff interest level: 0.199
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * Jason leads this all-time series 3-1 and swept both of their matchups last year
      * Charles takes Brett: Hopkins
      * Patrick takes Jason
         * Allen Lazard or Josh Reynolds
            * Lazard
               * Been banged up the last couple of weeks but he'll be in there this week
               * Look, there are a lot of issues with the idea of starting Lazard here but Jason doesn't really have much of a choice
               * Lazard is at least on the field a lot so Tim Boyle can look his way before checking down to Breece Hall or getting sacked
               * Hosting the Falcons (9th)
            * Reynolds
               * Snaps and targets have been seemingly declining lately but he still sees a decent amount of work
               * It's not great but he is coming off a game in which he scored a touchdown
               * You certainly like Jared Goff more than Tim Boyle
               * At the Saints (6th)
      * Pat projection: Jason
      * Charles prediction
   * James/Charles (3-9, .000/.000/.000, 17%) vs. Mitch (9-3, .992/.997/.963, 83%) 072
      * Playoff interest level: 0.006
      * Decision interest level: 0.066
      * Mitch leads the all-time series 8-3 and has won the last two in a row
      * Charles takes James/Charles: Woods
      * Patrick takes Mitch
         * Rhamondre Stevenson or D'Andre Swift
            * Stevenson
               * Been coming on lately
               * Three straight games in double digits, two of them had him scoring touchdowns
               * Over that same span, he's been averaging well over 4 YPC, which was not really his thing at the beginning of the season
               * No clue who'll be playing quarterback but it doesn't seem to affect Stevenson
               * Hosting the Chargers (23rd)
            * Swift
               * Just a solid running back, probably the safer option
               * He hasn't done anything especially flashy this season but his only total let-down game of the year was back in Week 1
               * He's gotten at least seven points in every game since and six of those games have been double-digits
               * Hosting the 49ers (2nd)
      * Pat projection: Mitch
      * Charles prediction
   * Patrick (5-7, .000/.000/.000, 24%) vs. Mike (9-3, .998/1.000/.989, 76%) 064
      * Playoff interest level: 0.003
      * Decision interest level: 0.061
      * New H2H series
      * Patrick takes Patrick
         * This one's for my buddy Mitch
         * Kadarius Toney or George Pickens
            * Toney
               * Welp
               * No sugar-coating this: he's been horrible this year and I really wish I would've taken any one of the many, many offers Mitch made me for him these last three years
               * He's not on the field much and he doesn't really get thrown to but once or twice a game
               * So why is this a question?
               * Well, Mecole Hardman left their game with injury a couple of weeks ago and is out for the rest of the season
               * For that game, at least, Toney took over the punt return duties, which could actually carve out a place for him on the team and in my lineup if that keeps up
               * Toney missed last week's game with injury but practiced in full today and seems good to go
               * At the Packers (24th)
            * Pickens
               * I dunno, he's been really boring this year; couple of great games, couple of fine games, lots of mediocre to poor games
               * He'll score like 3-5 points and that'll presume to be competitive with whatever Toney does
               * Hosting the Cardinals (30th)
      * Charles takes Mike: Hill
      * Pat projection: Mike
      * Charles prediction
   * Luke (5-7, .000/.000/.000, 58%) vs. Quinn (2-10, .000/.000/.000, 42%) 000
      * Playoff interest level: 0.000
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * Quinn leads the all-time series 6-4; the outcome has alternated each of the last six meetings and Luke won most recently
      * Charles takes Luke: James
      * Patrick takes Quinn
         * I think this roster will shake out to this decision
         * Michael Carter or Dalvin Cook
            * Carter
               * The good news: coming off his best game of the season!
               * The bad news: four carries for 19 yards; four receptions for 15 yards
               * The ugly news: those eight touches are two more than he's seen in any other game this year
               * At the Steelers (20th)
            * Cook
               * The bad news: Coming off a one carry for two yards rushing performance
               * The okay news: He saw three targets and made two catches for 19 yards
               * The nevermind, it's bad news: those 2.1 fantasy points are an above-median performance for him this season
               * Hosting the Falcons (3rd)
      * Pat projection: Quinn
      * Charles prediction
