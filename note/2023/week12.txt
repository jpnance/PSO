         * James Conner or Javonte Williams
            * Conner
               * Missed a big chunk of time this season but has played in two straight games, getting 30 carries across both
               * YPC numbers look pretty good, he just hasn't gotten in the end zone since he's been back
               * Hosting the Rams (10th)
            * Williams
               * Not really sure how much work he's gonna get: three games ago, he got 27 carries; two games again, he got 21; last week, just 11 carries
               * His YPC has been really lousy this season
               * Hasn't scored a rushing touchdown but has scored two receiving touchdowns, both coming fairly recently
               * Hosting the Browns (11th)
      * Pat projection: Schex
      * Charles prediction

      * Playoff interest level: 0.407
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * Keyon leads this all-time series 10-9 but Luke has won the two most recent meetings, including in Week 4
      * Charles takes Luke: Johnston
      * Patrick takes Keyon
         * Odell Beckham or Romeo Doubs
            * Beckham
               * Hadn't done hardly anything this season until the most recent three games: 9.60, 10.00, and, most recently, 11.60, scoring touchdowns in two of those games
               * No clue how many targets he's gonna get: might be 7, might be 2.
               * At the Chargers (31st)
            * Doubs
               * Workload is a bit more consistent
               * Scored a touchdown in each of the last two games and he's scored seven on the season
               * He doesn't get much yardage but he's obviously a significant threat to finish off drives for the Packers
               * At the Lions (23rd)
      * Pat projection: Keyon
      * Charles prediction
   * Justin (9-2, .986/.998/.965, 62%) vs. Brett (5-6, .010/.024/.001, 38%) 392
      * Playoff interest level: 0.246
      * Decision interest level: 0.146
      * The all-time series is tied 1-1 and Brett won in Week 4
      * Charles takes Justin: Tagovailoa
      * Patrick takes Brett
         * DeAndre Hopkins or Terry McLaurin
            * Hopkins
               * Coming off 4 catches on 5 targets for 59 yards and a touchdown
               * Five targets was his lowest since Week 6, so Will Levis is definitely looking for him
               * Hosting the Panthers (5th)
            * McLaurin
               * Despite a ton of targets, it's just not there for Terry McLaurin this year
               * He's only scored two touchdowns all season, the most recent coming in Week 8
               * He hasn't gotten fewer than seven targets since Week 5 but, right now, he just sorta looks like a guy who'll score a few points and not much more
               * At the Cowboys (3rd)
      * Pat projection: Justin
      * Charles prediction
   * Patrick (4-7, .000/.000/.000, 27%) vs. Mitch (9-2, .980/.993/.945, 73%) 391

      * Patrick takes Patrick
         * Mike Gesicki or Tyler Higbee
            * Gesicki
               * Most recent game: two catches on three targets for 22 yards
               * At the Giants (8th)
            * Higbee
               * Most recent game: one catch on three targets for 17 yards
               * At the Cardinals (9th)
      * Charles takes Mitch: Stevenson
      * Pat projection: Mitch
      * Charles prediction
   * Koci/Mueller (7-4, .612/.659/.306, 87%) vs. James/Charles (3-8, .000/.000/.000, 13%) 096
      * Playoff interest level: 0.054
      * Decision interest level: 0.041
      * Koci/Mueller lead this all-time series 6-5 and won back in Week 4
      * Patrick takes Koci/Mueller
         * This one's probably a gift but it's the only thing I can squint and think is questionable on their offense this week
         * Kenny Pickett or Zay Flowers
            * Pickett
               * Steelers offense has been such a joke this season, especially the last several games
               * I can't even be bothered to read Pickett's stats to you but they're like the worst stats you can imagine for someone who hasn't actually had a negative game
               * Matt Canada got fired, so I'm sure you like that
               * Confirmed to be the starter!
               * Matchup's also pretty good
               * At the Bengals (24th)
            * Flowers
               * Keeps getting catches that aren't touchdowns and scoring a few but not a lot of points
               * Nothing more to say, really, but the matchup is tasty
               * At the Chargers (31st)
      * Charles takes James/Charles: Johnson
      * Pat projection: Koci/Mueller
      * Charles prediction
   * Jason (2-9, .000/.000/.000, 57%) vs. Quinn (2-9, .000/.000/.000, 43%) 000
      * Playoff interest level: 0.000
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * The all-time series is tied 2-2 and Quinn won earlier this year in Week 4
      * Charles takes Jason: Elliott
      * Patrick takes Quinn
         * Desmond Ridder or Courtland Sutton
            * Ridder
               * He's back! Arthur Smith swears he's gonna be the guy for the rest of the season; truly baffling stuff
               * Really variable year: a couple of 20s and a bunch of single-digits
               * Hosting the Saints (16th)
            * Sutton
               * You know how all Jakobi Meyers does is catch touchdowns?
               * All Courtland Sutton does is catch touchdowns
               * Five straight games with a touchdown and seven of the last eight
               * Eight touchdowns on the season, all of them in different games
               * Only four double-digit games is hilarious, given the end zone looks
               * His floor, however, seems to be six points, you know?
               * Hosting the Browns (2nd)
      * Pat projection: Quinn
      * Charles prediction
