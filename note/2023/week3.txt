* Game Previews and Risky Player Options for Week 3
   * Record Distribution
      * Where we are
         * 0-2 teams are 5/50 (.100) at making the playoffs
            * None of the five who made the playoffs had above-.500 all-play records after two weeks and a couple of them were quite poor, so it's hard to know one way or the other
         * 1-1 teams are 23/72 (.319)
         * 2-0 teams are 32/50 (.640)
      * Where we're going
         * 3-0 teams are 21/30 (.700)
         * 2-1 teams are 30/57 (.526)
         * 1-2 teams are 9/54 (.167)
         * 0-3 teams are 0/31 (.000)
   * Mike (2-0) vs. Mitch (2-0)
      * Mike is seeking his franchise's fifth-ever 3-0 start (2012, 2017, 2019, and 2020 Trevor)
      * Mitch is seeking his second-ever 3-0 start (2013 Mitch, the one that set a bunch of records)
      * New head-to-head series
      * Patrick takes Mike
         * Jerry Jeudy or Tyler Allgeier
            * Jeudy
               * Missed Week 1 but got back out there in Week 2
               * Three catches on five targets for 25 yards
               * Not too great!
               * At the Dolphins (4th)
            * Algeier
               * After getting 15 carries for 75 yards and two touchdowns in Week 1, Allgeier got 16 carries for 48 yards and no touchdowns in Week 2
               * Bijan got more carries and was way more effective, so you're worried about that a little
               * At the Lions (16th)
      * Charles takes Mitch
      * Pat projection: Mike
      * Charles prediction
   * Luke (1-1) vs. James/Charles (1-1)
      * Both teams looking for that important 2-1 start
      * Luke leads the all-time series 5-3 and won the most recent meeting
      * Patrick takes Luke
         * Justin Watson or Jaxon Smith-Njigba
            * Watson
               * Hasn't gotten a ton of targets yet but he's averaging over 20 yards per catch
               * 5 catches on 9 targets for 107 total yards
               * Mahomes is looking for him as much as he is anyone else, so you like that
               * Hosting the Bears (25th)
            * Smith-Njigba
               * Showed slight improvement in Week 2
               * Five catches on six targets for 34 yards
               * Nothing to write home about, really, but Geno Smith is looking for him
               * Hosting the Panthers (2nd)
      * Charles takes James/Charles
      * Pat projection: Luke
      * Charles prediction
   * Patrick (1-1) vs. Brett (1-1)
      * Both teams looking for that important 2-1 start
      * Brett leads the all-time series 2-1, having won the most recent two meetings
      * Patrick takes Patrick
         * I feel like you can make a serious case for leaving any one of my four candidate running backs on the bench this week but I guess I feel like these are my last two in
         * Najee Harris or James Cook
            * Harris
               * This sure escalated quickly!
               * On the season 16 carries for 74 yards and no touchdowns; not any kind of factor in the passing game
               * Jaylen Warren is there, too, but he hasn't yet gotten more carries than Harris
               * The Steelers just haven't really been running the ball much, which is strange
               * At the Raiders (28th)
            * Cook
               * Great start for him so far: 29 carries for 169 yards
               * Yet to score a touchdown but he's the clear guy out of the gate
               * Also chimes in via the passing game: eight receptions on ten targets for another 53 yards
               * The matchup is the main thing that may give you pause
               * At the Commanders (6th)
      * Charles takes Brett
      * Pat projection: Patrick
      * Charles prediction
   * Jason (1-1) vs. Schex (1-1)
      * Both teams looking for that important 2-1 start
      * The all-time series is tied 1-1 but Schex won the most recent meaning
      * Patrick takes Jason
         * Chase Claypool or Calvin Austin
            * Claypool
               * Three catches on eight targets for 36 yards and a touchdown
               * Not a great day, necessarily, but the touchdown makes it okay
               * Way better than his zero catches on two targets day in Week 1
               * At the Chiefs (9th)
            * Austin
               * Gets a decent number of targets (10 on the season) but also contributes in the kick return game
               * Last week, he only had one catch on four targets for 10 yards but contributed a couple more points from KR/PR duties
               * At the Raiders (23rd)
      * Charles takes Schex
      * Pat projection: Schex
      * Charles prediction
   * Justin (1-1) vs. Quinn (0-2)
      * Justin looking for his second win of the season
      * Quinn looking to avoid his third 0-3 start of his solo ownership regime
      * Quinn won the only meeting between these teams last year
      * Patrick takes Justin
         * This isn't what I thought would happen but would you believe that Kirk Cousins is the #1 quarterback entering Week 3? And he's got a great matchup this week?
         * Tua Tagovailoa or Jared Goff
            * Tagovailoa
               * The only real knock against the #6 quarterback is that he's turned the ball over three times in two games and has another three fumbles that just weren't lost
               * A good game will put him past 1,000 yards passing in just three weeks
               * Hosting the Broncos (20th)
            * Goff
               * The only real knock against the #11 quarterback is that he just didn't have a 460-yard passing game like Tua did
               * Only one turnover and three sacks this season, so things are really going quite well for him
               * Hosting the Falcons (12th)
      * Charles takes Quinn
      * Pat projection: Justin
      * Charles prediction
   * Koci/Mueller (0-2) vs. Keyon (1-1)
      * Koci/Mueller looking to avoid their second 0-3 start in three seasons
      * Keyon looking to get to 2-1
      * Keyon leads the all-time series 13-5 and has won four in a row, the last Koci/Mueller win coming all the way back in 2018
      * Patrick takes Koci/Mueller
         * Gus Edwards or Dameon Pierce
            * Edwards
               * 10 carries for 62 yards and a touchdown last week
               * Impressive numbers in a situation where, once again, the Ravens are probably just hoping that someone will step up
               * Perhaps Gus Edwards has stepped up!
               * Hosting the Colts (12th)
            * Pierce
               * Week 1: 11 carries for 38 yards
               * Week 2: 15 carries for 31 yards
               * Been tough so far and he's actually been outscored by Edwards in both weeks
               * He's still the guy, though, so maybe this'll be the week?
               * At the Jaguars (3rd)
      * Charles takes Keyon
      * Pat projection: Koci/Mueller
      * Charles prediction


* High Scorer's Corner: Luke
   * APPLAUSE
   * Luke scored 173.60
   * 1st scoring title this season
   * 11th scoring title all-time (T-8th overall)
