* Discussion Topic: Season Retrospectives: 8th through 5th
   * Patrick takes Brett
      * 8th place, 7-8, 74-91
      * What worked out
         * C.J. Stroud ($30, 23/25) has had a really amazing rookie season; he seems to be both a good NFL quarterback and a good fantasy option
         * Mike Evans ($45, 23/24): I feel like we haven't really talked about him enough this year but at just $45, Mike Evans has been the #3 WR; 13 touchdowns this season and looking like one of the best contracts around
         * Russell Wilson ($124, 23/23), I'll say it: he's worked out! Even though he's gonna be the backup for the final two games of the season, he's the #9 QB at time of writing
         * Tank Dell ($4, 23/24), selected with #3.05 (#29 overall), got hurt at the end of the season but was really producing well
      * What didn't
         * Injuries, oh my word
            * Aaron Rodgers ($135, 23/24) got Achilles'd on like the first drive of the season; we don't need to talk any more than we already have about this person
            * J.K. Dobbins ($99, 23/24) just can't catch a break in the NFL; tore his Achilles in the first game of the season and who knows what his future holds
            * Nick Chubb ($180, 21/23) in the final year of a three-year contract, tears his ACL in Week 2 and misses the rest of the season; maybe that'll depress his price a little at auction?
         * Terry McLaurin ($94, 22/24) just had a bad season; Sam Howell put up stats but they just weren't tending to go Terry's way and his $95 price tag just doesn't look very good when he's the #34 WR
         * Trading away Sam LaPorta for Khalil Herbert is one that Brett would surely like to have back; Herbert got injured soon after that trade and Sam LaPorta is the #1 TE
         * Not a bust by any means but Garrett Wilson ($16, 22/24) didn't take that step forward that we wanted to see from him, though we'll note that we thought Aaron Rodgers was gonna be a part of that step forward
         * Same with Christian Watson ($8, 22/23)
      * What Brett has to look forward to in 2024
         * One first-rounder: #4 overall
         * Four second-rounders: #13, #17, two in the bottom four
         * $464 available
         * All of Brett's useful WRs are signed through next year (with the exception of Christian Watson)
         * Currently, J.K. Dobbins is the only running back of note he's got signed
         * Aaron Rodgers will be a cut candidate (it depends, though!) but the C.J. Stroud contract is exciting
         * In order to compete, Brett will definitely need to make sure he shores up his second quarterback slot and addresses running back
   * Charles takes Patrick
      * 7th place, 7-8, 82-83
   * Patrick takes Schex
      * 6th place, 8-7, 88-77
         * Schex's team was, I think, unusually fluid this year, so these are all kinda tough to come up with
         * What worked out
            * Anthony Richardson ($30, 23/25)  looked really exciting and helped Schex execute a big deadline deal
            * Zack Moss ($15, 23/23) helped steady the ship while Jonathan Taylor missed time with his whole thing
            * DJ Moore ($90, 23/25), I guess, although he was really inconsistent
            * Same with Calvin Ridley ($42, 22/24)
            * Evan Engram ($1, 22/24), although it took forever for him to score his first touchdown
            * Rashid Shaheed ($11, 23/25) was really playable
         * What didn't
            * Anthony Richardson sprained his AC joint and his season ended after Week 5
            * Justin Jefferson ($250, 23/24) missed the bulk of the season
            * Justin Fields ($29, 21/23) got injured and missed time midseason but just hasn't found that consistency that we were hoping he'd find; it'll be interesting to see what he goes for this summer
            * Jonathan Taylor ($198, 23/24) certainly didn't return $198 but it feels like we've seen enough this year that that price tag seems totally fine, or good even, for next year
            * JaMarr Chase ($16, 21/23) was good but not great for the games he played on Schex's team
         * What Schex has to look forward to in 2024
            * As it stands now, Schex's first pick won't be until #5.02
            * $192 available
            * He's got no known-starting quarterbacks signed for next year but you like his running backs a lot and can easily talk yourself into his WRs and TEs
            * I'll be interested to see how he addresses the QB issue; $192 can't buy two that you feel great about but, given the rest of his team, he might not need to feel great about them
   * Charles takes Keyon
      * 5th place, 9-6, 92-73


* Game Previews and Risky Player Options for the Championship Round
   * The only week all season that the game of the week doesn't get top billing
   * #2 Justin vs. #3 Mike
      * This is Justin's first third-place game appearance
      * This is Mike's first third-place game appearance
      * Justin is 2-0 against Mike this season but…
      * Including the playoffs, the weekly head-to-head series is tied 8-8 and…
      * Since Week 10, Mike is 5-2
      * Charles takes Justin: Siemian
      * Patrick takes Mike
         * Mike sent in an RPO involving Sam Howell but we now know that he's been benched so I think this is what'll help Mike out the most
         * I think he should figure on Josh Jacobs starting and be worried about Isiah Pacheco not getting out of the concussion protocol in time for this Sunday
         * In which case, he'll need to make this call:
         * Tyler Allgeier or Jerry Jeudy
            * Allgeier
               * Quixotically, he's gotten 175 carries this season despite Bijan Robinson, you know, existing
               * The reality, though, is that he's gotten no fewer than seven carries in any game this season and although his YPC is poor, he did score a touchdown last week
               * No passing game work, really, because Bijan's way better than him at that as well
               * At the Bears (20th)
            * Jeudy
               * I don't think there's any more that we or Steve Smith haven't already said about Jerry Jeudy
               * Main thing with him for Week 16 is that it won't be Russell Wilson; apparently, if Russell Wilson can't pass a physical in March, he gets a bunch of guaranteed money so the Broncos aren't interested in that happening
               * That means that Jarrett Stidham is back in action and will be throwing footballs, some of them, presumably, to Jerry Jeudy
               * Hosting the Chargers (30th)
      * The Simulator has Mike winning this one 52% of the time
      * Pat projection: Mike
      * Charles prediction
   * #1 Koci/Mueller vs. #4 Mitch
      * This is Koci/Mueller's seventh championship game appearance
      * This is Mitch's fifth championship game appearance
      * Koci/Mueller won the regular season meeting between these two teams back in Week 14
      * Including the playoffs, Koci/Mueller lead the weekly head-to-head series 10-6
      * No matter what arbitrary cut-off you choose, it just gets better for the Surnamers because they started out the season 0-3 against Mitch
      * Koci/Mueller have lost in championship game three times (2012, 2014, and 2019); Mitch has only lost in the championship game once (2015)
      * These are the only two franchises to win back-to-back PSO championships and, of course, Mitch is looking to do it for the second time in his history
      * Both franchises are looking to join Schex at a league-leading four championship game wins
      * Patrick gives Koci/Mueller monologue
         * By this point, we're all well aware that Koci/Mueller have made some league history: no other team has gotten off to an 0-3 start and made the playoffs that same season
         * It may or may not surprise you, though, that there are three other teams in our history who have finished in last place in one season and made the playoffs in the next
         * Other teams to go from last place (after tiebreakers) to playoffs (in reverse order)
            * Quinn
               * 2018: 2-12
               * 2019: Finished in third place
            * Quinn
               * 2016: 4-10
               * 2017: Finished in fourth place
            * Syed/Terence
               * 2015: 2-12
               * 2016: Won the championship
         * There are a couple of owners in this league who have given us clear ways to characterize their franchise's league history
            * Schex: consistent regular season success and all the accolades to go with it
            * Keyon: consistent regular season success but none of the accolades to go with it
         * I think Koci/Mueller are on that list, too, but maybe for the wrong reason
         * The Surnamers aren't as active on the chat line as a bunch of us degenerates so I think it's easy to see them as kind of mysterious
         * When we talk about them on our offseason previews or our auction recaps or whenever we're scrutinizing their calls in GroupMe, we always seem to say things like, "I'm not sure what they're thinking but they're smart, so I'm sure they'll figure something out"
         * Although you can't look at their regular seasons and find nearly that same level of consistency, their highs are just as high as anyone's
         * They've got three championships to their name and three more seasons where they came up just a game short
         * And what's mysterious about getting yourself in a position to go and pay big money for great players? …about drafting promising rookies with good pedigrees?
         * Win or lose this week, they've completed an amazing rebuilding project
         * I remembered that they finished 2-13 last year but had totally forgotten they finished 1-14 the year before that
         * Well, seasons like this just remind us that we've had it right the whole time: these guys are smart and they absolutely know how to figure things out
         * The only mystery is why this team started 0-3 because, without a doubt, it's one of the finest teams that this three-time champion co-ownership group has ever produced
      * Patrick takes Koci/Mueller
         * This lineup is just so lock-tight that this is really all I see that could possibly be of any help
         * Isaiah Likely or Dallas Goedert
            * Likely
               * Talked about him a bit already but the long and short of it is: he's been pretty good since Mark Andrews went on IR!
               * Couldn't extend his scoring streak to three games last week but still caught three passes for 56 yards
               * Lamar likes him
               * Hosting the Dolphins (12th)
            * Goedert
               * Coming off his best game since recovering from his broken arm: 7 catches on 9 targets for 71 yards
               * In addition, that means he's gotten 9 targets in consecutive games, so you feel good about who Hurts is looking for
               * Hosting the Cardinals (15th)
            * Admittedly, maybe Koci/Mueller want to limit their investment in the Eagles here but, if it's just about which of these TEs is scoring more points…?
      * Charles gives Mitch monologue
      * Charles takes Mitch: Mason Rudolph
      * The Simulator has Koci/Mueller winning this one 60% of the time
      * Pat projection: Koci/Mueller
      * Charles prediction


* High Scorer's Corner: Koci/Mueller
   * APPLAUSE
   * Koci/Mueller scored 165.14
   * Doesn't technically count as a weekly scoring title, of course
