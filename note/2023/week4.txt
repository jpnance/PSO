* Game Previews and Risky Player Options for Week 4
   * Mike (3-0) vs. Schex (2-1)
      * New H2H matchup
      * Patrick takes Mike
         * There's really just nothing of interest on Mike's team right now, so…
         * Noah Fant or George Kittle
            * Fant
               * Total nonfactor in Week 1 but has since caught 8 of his 9 targets for a total of 97 receiving yards
               * Still looking for his first touchdown
               * At the Giants (18th)
            * Kittle
               * Been somewhat better than Fant; he's coming off a 7 catch, 90 yards receiving game
               * You do certainly love the usage over: 13 catches on 18 targets so far
               * Still looking for his first touchdown as well
               * Hosting the Cardinals (17th)
      * Charles takes Schex
      * Pat projection: Schex

      * Patrick takes Patrick
         * Najee Harris or Rachaad White
            * Harris
               * More than doubled his carries on the season in Week 3 but only to the tune of 65 yards
               * It's been really tough for him this season: just 139 rushing yards on 35 carries
               * Good matchup, though!
               * At the Texans (29th)
            * White
               * Wasn't able to replicate his 16-point Week 2 this past Sunday
               * 14 carries but just 38 yards on the ground, and he lost a fumble
               * Still on the field a ton and clearly they wanna use him
               * At the Saints (5th)
      * Charles takes Mitch
      * Pat projection: Mitch
      * Charles prediction
   * Justin (2-1) vs. Brett (1-2)
      * Justin won the only previous meeting between these two franchises
      * Patrick takes Justin
         * Lions back on Thursday Night Football so we still can't do the one true RPO for Justin
         * Jaylen Waddle or Elijah Moore
            * Waddle
               * Hosting the Dolphins (16th)
            * Moore
               * Hosting the Ravens (22nd)
      * Charles takes Brett
      * Pat projection: Justin
      * Charles prediction
   * Luke (1-2) vs. Keyon (2-1)
      * JAGUAR GAME
      * Keyon leads the all-time series 10-8 but Luke won the most recent meeting, snapping a six-game winning streak by Keyon
      * Charles takes Luke
      * Patrick takes Keyon
         * Kyle Pitts or David Njoku
            * Pitts
               * Five catches on nine targets for 41 yards last week, no touchdown
               * Desmond Ridder does not seem all that interested in throw the ball his way: 9 catches on 17 targets all season
               * In London to play the Jaguars (28th)
            * Njoku
               * But Njoku's had an even slower start
               * 10 catches on 11 targets but just 92 yards all season
               * Hard to feel great about either one of these guys right now
               * Hosting the Ravens (2nd)
      * Pat projection: Luke
      * Charles prediction
   * Koci/Mueller (0-3) vs. James/Charles (2-1)
      * The all-time series is tied 5-5 but James/Charles have won the most recent three meetings
      * Patrick takes Koci/Mueller
         * Nico Collins or Zay Flowers
            * Collins
               * All over the map out of the gate: one fine game, one good game, one bad game
               * Most recently, just two catches on three targets for 34 yards
               * Easily his lowest usage of the season, though, so you hope that'll bump up this week
               * Hosting the Steelers (28th)
            * Flowers
               * So far in his three-game career, he's a target machine: 21 catches on 26 targets for 188 yards
               * Hasn't yet scored a touchdown but it seems like it's just a matter of time with that usage rate
               * At the Browns (1st)
      * Charles takes James/Charles
      * Pat projection: Koci/Mueller
      * Charles prediction
   * Jason (1-2) vs. Quinn (0-3)
      * Jason leads the all-time series 2-1 and won the most recent meeting
      * Charles takes Jason
      * Patrick takes Quinn
         * Chris Godwin or Michael Gallup
            * Godwin
               * So far, he's been fine but nothing you're excited to roll out every week
               * 13 catches on 17 targets for 141 yards and no touchdown
               * Scored between 5 and 6 points each week so far
               * Baker Mayfield's really just focused on Mike Evans
               * At the Saints (15th)
            * Gallup
               * Got off to a very slow start in the first couple of weeks but showed up in Week 3: six catches on seven targets for 92 yards
               * Still looking for his first touchdown of the season
               * Hosting the Patriots (10th)
      * Pat projection: Quinn
      * Charles prediction

   * APPLAUSE
   * Justin scored 162.54
   * 2nd scoring title this season
   * 3rd scoring title all-time (14th overall)
