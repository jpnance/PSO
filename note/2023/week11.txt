* Transactions
   * Free Agency


* Game Previews and Risky Player Options for Week 11
   * Rematch Week #2!
   * Top 6 teams are back to not playing each other and the simulator sees each matchup as being fairly lopsided so the interest levels in these games are really low
   * That means, though, that if any of the favorites slip up, that could be a huge setback
   * Koci/Mueller (6-4, .580/.681/.321, 72%) vs. Luke (4-6, .000/.000/.000, 28%) 206
      * Playoff interest level: 0.119
      * Decision interest level: 0.087
      * Luke leads this all-time series 12-10 but Koci/Mueller won in Week 5
      * Charles takes Koci/Mueller
      * Patrick takes Luke
         * This is really the only thing that seems at all reasonable so we're running it back
         * Quentin Johnston or Wan'Dale Robinson
            * Johnston
               * Caught all four of his targets for 34 yards and a touchdown last week
               * Easily the best fantasy game of his rookie season
               * Tough matchup, though
               * At the Packers (7th)
            * Robinson
               * Didn't get anything going at all last week
               * Two catches on three targets for just six yards
               * Limited in practice, too, but you'll be injury protected
               * Great matchup
               * At the Commanders (31st)
      * Pat projection: Koci/Mueller
      * Charles prediction
   * Brett (5-5, .030/.027/.032, 37%) vs. Mitch (8-2, .970/1.000/.919, 63%) 164
      * Playoff interest level: 0.017
      * Decision interest level: 0.147
      * Mitch leads the all-time series 3-1 and won back in Week 5
      * Patrick takes Brett
         * DeAndre Hopkins or Tank Dell
            * Hopkins
               * Lots of targets lately: 9 last week, 11 the week before that
               * Not a ton to show for it, though: just 7 catches for 87 yards and no touchdowns
               * He's only had one game with a touchdown this year and he had a hat trick in that game
               * At the Jaguars (22nd)
            * Dell
               * Another game, another touchdown for Tank Dell
               * 6 catches on 14 (!) targets for 56 yards and a score
               * His second straight game in double-digits and fourth such game of the season
               * Hosting the Cardinals (17th)
      * Charles takes Mitch
      * Pat projection: Mitch
      * Charles prediction
   * Schex (6-4, .400/.508/.200, 65%) vs. Quinn (2-8, .000/.000/.000, 35%) 148
      * Playoff interest level: 0.148
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * Schex leads the all-time series 9-3 and won back in Week 5
      * Charles takes Schex
      * Patrick takes Quinn
         * K.J. Osborn or Michael Gallup
            * Osborn
               * Coming off his worst game of the season, which is obviously troubling given the change at quarterback in Minnesota
               * If you're not that worried about that, though, Osborn has gotten a bunch of targets this year and is a pretty consistent source of decent points
               * Yet to get into double-digits but a lot of games between 4 and 10
               * I know that doesn't sound exciting but it plays in Quinn's lineup right now
               * Hosting the Saints (8th)
            * Gallup
               * Coming off his best game of the season: 2 catches on 2 targets for 70 yards and a touchdown
               * Gallup has not been a decent source of points this year and only has three games that you'd even consider acceptable
               * At the Panthers (4th)
      * Pat projection: Schex
      * Charles prediction
   * Mike (7-3, .910/.973/.720, 75%) vs. Jason (2-8, .000/.000/.000, 25%) 113
      * Playoff interest level: 0.065
      * Decision interest level: 0.048
      * Mike won the only previous meeting of these two franchises back in Week 5
      * Charles takes Mike
      * Patrick takes Jason
         * I only see one skill player thing on Jason's roster that you could plausibly ask about and it may not even matter because he may have to start both of them
         * We need to make sure we have a complete RPO XI this season so here we go, Charles
         * Nick Folk or Daniel Carlson
            * Folk
               * #6 kicker so far this season; six games in double-digits
               * At the Jaguars (5th)
            * Carlson
               * #20 kicker so far this season; two straight games scoring 14 points, though, in the post-Josh-McDaniels era
               * At the Dolphins (8th)
      * Pat projection: Mike
      * Charles prediction
   * Patrick (4-6, .000/.000/.000, 26%) vs. Justin (8-2, .990/1.000/.962, 74%) 107
      * Playoff interest level: 0.010
      * Decision interest level: 0.097
      * Justin has won both meetings between these two franchises, including, of course, back in Week 5
      * Patrick takes Patrick
         * Jayden Reed or George Pickens
            * Reed
               * Rookie WR for the Packers
               * Coming off his second-best game of the season: 5 catches on 5 targets for 84 yards and a touchdown
               * He's scored in a couple of other games, too, and gets a little return game work
               * Hosting the Chargers (28th)
            * Pickens
               * Targets have been down the last three weeks: just 14 total targets in that span and all three of his lowest target games this season
               * You'd mostly be going on pedigree here, I guess, because the matchup doesn't inspire confidence either
               * At the Browns (3rd)
      * Charles takes Justin
      * Pat projection: Justin
      * Charles prediction
   * Keyon (5-5, .120/.127/.095, 79%) vs. James/Charles (3-7, .000/.000/.000, 21%) 019
      * Playoff interest level: 0.019
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * Keyon leads this all-time series 8-3 and won back in Week 5
      * Patrick takes Keyon
         * Kareem Hunt or Aidan O'Connell
            * Hunt
               * Double-digit carries in each of the last five games as well as at least one touchdown
               * His yardages are actually quite low considering the work but you don't really care because his worst fantasy game over that span is 9.20
               * Hosting the Steelers (24th)
            * O'Connell
               * He's a quarterback
               * He's been an okay guy for the Raiders, all things considered
               * It doesn't really reflect in his fantasy numbers, though: just 5.42 last week and 8.36 the week before that
               * At the Dolphins (26th)
      * Charles takes James/Charles
      * Pat projection: James/Charles
      * Charles prediction


* High Scorer's Corner: Brett
   * APPLAUSE
   * Brett scored 165.11
   * 1st scoring title this season
   * 3rd scoring title all-time (15th overall)
