      * Justin won the only meeting between these two teams back in Week 7
      * Patrick takes Justin
         * I may be making a mistake here but, I dunno, I like it
         * Kenneth Walker or Jaylen Waddle
            * Walker
               * Walker had been hurt but got back on the field last week against the 49ers and their second ranked fantasy defense against running backs
               * Just 21 yards on eight carries for Walker; did get a little passing game stuff; overall, a bad day
               * Zach Charbonnet did get one more carry than Walker, so read into that what you will
               * Hosting the Eagles (1st)
            * Waddle
               * Four straight games with exactly eight targets
               * He's turning those targets into decent numbers of yards and his worst game in that stretch is 5.20
               * Hasn't scored a touchdown since Week 8, though
               * Hosting the Jets (1st)

      * Pat projection: Justin
      * Charles prediction

      * Playoff interest level: 0.000
      * Decision interest level: 0.170
      * A win earns Keyon the #1 overall pick in the next rookie draft
      * A win keeps Mitch alive for The Decision
      * Keyon leads the all-time series 10-5 but Mitch has won the last two in a row, including back in Week 7

      * Patrick takes Mitch
         * Nick Mullens or Bailey Zappe
            * Mullens
               * Welcome back, Nick Mullens!
               * Look, this is all I can say about Nick Mullens: He's a guy.
               * At the Bengals (23rd)
            * Zappe
               * Bailey Zappe is coming off the best fantasy game of his young career: 19/28 for three touchdowns and one interception
               * I dunno, though, this guy like kept re-losing his job to Mac Jones
               * Hosting the Chiefs (16th)
      * Pat projection: Mitch
      * Charles prediction
   * Brett (6-8, eliminated, 41%) vs. Schex (8-6, .000/.000/.000, 59%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.000
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * Schex leads the all-time series 5-1 but Brett won back in Week 7
      * Charles takes Brett
      * Patrick takes Schex
         * James Conner or Marquise Brown
            * Conner
               * Coming off a great game in which he rushed for 105 yards on 25 carries and scored two touchdowns: you love that!
               * It took him a few games to get going coming back from injury but he finally had a good one and we know this guy can be really effective in this offense
               * Tough matchup, though!
               * Hosting the 49ers (2nd)
            * Brown
               * He hasn't really reconnected with Kyler Murray the way we thought he might
               * He does still figure to be Murray's favorite WR target, though, and the matchup bodes way better for him than his teammate
               * Hosting the 49ers (24th)
      * Pat projection: Schex
      * Charles prediction

         * Dallas Goedert or Isaiah Likely
            * Goedert
               * Made it back into action after missing a month with a broken arm
               * Didn't have a great game but did catch all four of his targets for 30 yards
               * At the Seahawks (16th)
            * Likely
               * Last week: 5 catches on 7 targets for 83 yards and a touchdown
               * You love that, obviously!
               * It's otherwise been a pretty lousy season with Mark Andrews just getting all the work
               * Andrews is on IR, though, so you've gotta consider Likely in your list of options
               * The matchup is great, too
               * At the Jaguars (29th)
      * Charles takes Quinn: Kmet

            * Anzalone
               * Having a good season, but been banged up lately

            * Hubbard
               * Coming off a 23 carry performance of his own but no passing numbers or touchdown to show for it
               * Just a couple weeks ago, though, he had a two-touchdown game
               * Hosting the Falcons (5th)
