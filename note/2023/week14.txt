* Game Previews and Risky Player Options for Week 14
   * Koci/Mueller (9-4, .974/1.000/.939, 58%) vs. Mitch (10-3, clinched, 42%) 811
      * Playoff interest level: 0.026
      * Decision interest level: 0.785
      * Mitch leads the all-time series 8-7 and has won the last two meetings
      * Jason takes Koci/Mueller: Rashee Rice
      * Patrick takes Mitch
         * Cooper Kupp or Tee Higgins
            * Kupp
               * Got back in the end zone after a five-game scoring drought
               * Matthew Stafford's been on fire the last couple weeks but you kinda wouldn't know it by Kupp's numbers
               * He did score last week but he only has 9 catches on 13 targets for 57 receiving yards and one touchdown in that span
               * Puka Nacua seems to be Stafford's favorite target at the moment
               * At the Ravens (2nd)
            * Higgins
               * Missed a few weeks with injury but came back last week
               * 3 catches on 3 targets for 36 yards; not too impressive, obviously
               * He was seeing a bunch of targets with Burrow, though; maybe you were sufficiently impressed by Jake Browning last week?
               * I dunno, this is all there really was
               * Better matchup, at least
               * Hosting the Colts (15th)
      * Pat projection: Mitch
      * Jason prediction
   * Keyon (7-6, .011/.021/.000, 52%) vs. Jason (4-9, eliminated, 48%) 242
      * Playoff interest level: 0.242
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * Keyon leads the all-time series 2-1 and has won the last two meetings
      * Patrick takes Keyon
         * Gabe Davis or Drake London
            * Davis
               * Nice game last week: 6 catches on 12 targets for 105 yards and a touchdown
               * But that was against the Eagles (who are bad)
               * Best game of the season for him by just a little bit
               * We've talked about him before but he's a total boom or bust guy: six games north of double-digits, five games scoring three points or less
               * At the Chiefs (14th)
            * London
               * Horrible game last week: 1 catch on 5 targets for 8 yards and no touchdowns
               * He made the only catch by a Falcons wide receiver
               * But that was against the Jets (who are good)
               * London is definitely a steadier source of points than Davis but doesn't touch double digits as often
               * Hosting the Buccaneers (29th)
      * Jason takes Jason: Marquez Valdes-Scantling
      * Pat projection: Keyon
      * Jason prediction
   * Patrick (6-7, eliminated, 38%) vs. Schex (7-6, .017/.027/.000, 62%) 160
      * JAGUAR GAME
      * Playoff interest level: 0.160
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * Schex leads the all-time series 16-6 and has won the last four meetings
      * Patrick takes Patrick
         * If Jayden Reed seems like he isn't gonna play, let's pick between a couple of teammates
         * Adam Thielen or Jonathan Mingo
            * Thielen
               * Once upon a time, Adam Thielen had scored four touchdowns in the first six weeks of the season and was the #5 WR
               * Since then, he's had four games scoring fewer than five points and no game higher than 7.5
               * Hasn't been in the end zone since Week 6
               * Only nine targets the last two weeks combined, so it seems like he's losing looks to…
               * At the Saints (4th)
            * Mingo
               * No touchdowns on the season
               * Best game is 6.9, which is nice but, you know, not great
               * It's been looking up lately, though!
               * Two of his three best games on the season have come in the last two weeks
               * 16 targets over that span; 29 targets over the last four games
               * Maybe the coaching change was good for him?
               * At the Saints (4th)
      * Jason takes Schex: Gardner Minshew
      * Pat projection: Schex
      * Jason prediction
   * Mike (9-4, .998/1.000/.988, 82%) vs. Quinn (3-10, eliminated, 18%) 102
      * Playoff interest level: 0.002
      * Decision interest level: 0.100
      * New H2H series; Mike will complete his first trip through the entire league
      * Jason takes Mike: George Kittle
      * Patrick takes Quinn
         * Zay Jones or K.J. Osborn
            * Jones
               * Plagued by injury this season but has played three weeks in a row
               * Last week: 5 catches on 8 targets for 78 yards
               * Christian Kirk is missing a bunch of time so that presumably means there'll be more there for Jones
               * Oh yeah, C.J. Beathard might be throwing the passes
               * At the Browns (3rd)
            * Osborn
               * Not an exciting player by any means but he scores some points
               * I dunno, he gets targets, catches some of them, it generally comes out to like five points
               * At the Raiders (12th)
      * Pat projection: Mike
      * Jason prediction
   * Justin (9-4, 1.000/1.000/1.000, 85%) vs. James/Charles (3-10, eliminated, 15%) 049
      * Playoff interest level: 0.000
      * Decision interest level: 0.049
      * The all-time series is tied 1-1; James/Charles won the most recent meeting last year
      * Patrick takes Justin
         * I presume that Justin wants to start Kenneth Walker if he's healthy
         * If he's not, though…
         * Zach Charbonnet or Jaylen Waddle: conditioned on Kenneth Walker not being active
            * Charbonnet
               * With Walker out the last few weeks, Charbonnet has gotten a lot of touches
               * Hasn't been remotely efficient with them but he's kind of all the Seahawks have after Walker
               * He did score a touchdown last week
               * At the 49ers (22nd)
            * Waddle
               * Hasn't scored a touchdown since Week 8 but always seems to get a solid amount of work
               * Eight targets each of the last three weeks and more than 200 yards receiving over that span
               * Hosting the Titans (26th)
            * Again, this is only active if Kenneth Walker doesn't play; you will have injury protection on Charbonnet because Waddle is on Monday Night Football
      * Jason takes James/Charles: Will Levis
      * Pat projection: Justin
      * Jason prediction
   * Luke (5-8, eliminated, 42%) vs. Brett (6-7, eliminated, 58%) 000
      * Playoff interest level: 0.000
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * Luke leads the all-time series 3-1 and has won the last three meetings
      * Patrick takes Luke
         * Josh Downs or Justin Watson
            * Downs
               * Coming off a bad game: 3 catches on 5 targets for 14 yards and no touchdowns
               * Pretty promising rookie season but it's slowed down quite a bit lately
               * His four lowest snap percentages have all come in his last four games
               * At the Bengals (23rd)
            * Watson
               * Coming off a terrible game: 0 catches on 0 targets for 0 yards and 0 touchdowns
               * Scored touchdowns in each of the games before that, though
               * That's all I got; Mahomes looks for this guy for some reason
               * Hosting the Bills (11th)
      * Jason takes Brett: Khalil Shakir
      * Pat projection: Brett
      * Jason prediction


* High Scorer's Corner: Koci/Mueller
   * APPLAUSE
   * Koci/Mueller scored 170.33
   * 4th scoring title this season
   * 21st scoring title all-time (3rd overall)
