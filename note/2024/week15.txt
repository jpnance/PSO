* Discussion Topic: Tiebreakers
   * Be quick about resetting the tiebreakers
   * Throw it to Jason after the reset


* Game Previews and Risky Player Options for Week 15
   * Rematch Week #4!
      * Every game this week is a rematch of a game that happened in Week 7
      * 12 sweeps, 6 splits
      * Unless every single game this week results in a split, once again, splits will outnumber sweeps the way they have in fifteen of the other sixteen seasons we've been doing this thing
   * Keyon (12-2, clinched, 77%) vs. Anthony (9-5, .248/1.000/.019, 23%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.402
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * This is essentially a playoff game for Anthony
         * If he loses, he'd need Brett to upset Koci/Mueller and Mitch to upset Luke in order to advance to the playoffs
         * He can't win a two-way tie with Koci/Mueller because they split the season series and the Surnamers have a massive PF advantage
         * So he needs it to be a three-way tie that includes Luke; then he advances on his 1-2 record against the group versus the Surnamers' 1-3 record against it
      * Keyon leads the all-time series 1-0 and, of course, won in Week 7
      * Jason takes Keyon
         * Rico Dowdle or David Montgomery
      * Patrick takes Anthony
         * Nick Westbrook-Ikhine or Calvin Ridley
            * Westbrook-Ikhine
               * Impossibly did not score a touchdown last week!
               * One catch on two targets for 19 yards
               * Still has eight touchdowns in his last nine games, though!
               * Hosting the Bengals (23rd)
            * Ridley
               * Also wasn't very good last week but got way more looks than did his teammate
               * Seven catches on twelve targets for 59 yards
               * Broadly speaking, you should feel better about Ridley's workload but it's up to you to decide how you feel about their fantasy scores
               * Also hosting the Bengals (23rd)
      * Pat projection: Keyon
      * Jason prediction
   * Koci/Mueller (9-5, .767/.787/.701, 76%) vs. Brett (6-8, eliminated, 24%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.022
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * This game doesn't matter for Koci/Mueller unless Mitch upsets Luke; if that happens, then this is a playoff game for the champs
      * Brett would likely secure the #4 pick in the rookie draft next year with a win
      * Koci/Mueller lead the all-time series 4-3 and have won the last two in a row, including in Week 7
      * Patrick takes Koci/Mueller
         * Kyle Pitts or Chig Okonkwo
            * Pitts
               * Was doing fine when Kurt was doing fine but Kurt is not doing fine anymore so Kyle is also not doing fine
               * One catch on six targets for 14 yards this past week
               * Hasn't scored a touchdown since Week 8 and, since then, has been very often scoring less than two points
               * At the Raiders (30th)
            * Okonkwo
               * He's been bad this year!
               * He's also been bad lately!
               * Three catches on four targets for just eight yards last week
               * I dunno!
               * Hosting the Bengals (31st)
      * Jason takes Brett
         * T.J. Hockenson or Keon Coleman
      * Pat projection: Koci/Mueller
      * Jason prediction
   * Luke (9-5, .985/1.000/.816, 92%) vs. Mitch (0-14, eliminated, 8%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.015
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * Luke looking to officially punch his ticket into the playoffs
      * Mitch trying to avoid becoming PSO's first-ever winless team
      * Mitch leads the all-time series 10-7 but, of course, lost in Week 7
      * Jason takes Luke
         * Josh Downs or DK Metcalf
      * Patrick takes Mitch
         * Cam Akers or Samaje Perine
            * Akers
               * Doesn't get much work (five carries last week is a three-week high for him) but he's actually been quite effective with his touches
               * Averaging 4.9 yards per carry over his last three games
               * Nevertheless, they just give it to Aaron Jones over and over again
               * Hosting the Bears (26th)
            * Perine
               * Might or might not get a carry but he's gonna get at least a target or two and he does do kickoff returns as well
               * He and Cam Akers pretty much split their head-to-head performances over the last couple of months
               * I'm so glad to be done with Mitch's team this year
               * At the Browns (9th)
      * Pat projection: Luke
      * Jason prediction
   * Patrick (4-10, eliminated, 35%) vs. Quinn (7-7, eliminated, 65%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.000
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * Both teams trying to improve draft positioning
      * Patrick leads the all-time series 8-7 but Quinn has won the last four in a row, including in Week 7
      * Patrick takes Patrick
         * It's pretty hard to argue with my starting offensive lineup this week so, sorry, I'm sending myself off into the sunset with an IDP
         * Brandon Stephens or Xavier Woods
            * Stephens
               * Plays for the Ravens
               * Pretty steady over the last couple of months: no fewer than 5.5 points since Week 7
               * At Drew Lock (I guess?) and the Giants
            * Woods
               * Plays for the Panthers
               * On the field a lot
               * Interceptions in two of his last four games
               * Hosting Cooper Rush (I guess?) and the Cowboys
      * Jason takes Quinn
         * Kirk Cousins or Tommy DeVito
      * Pat projection: Quinn
      * Jason prediction
   * Justin (7-7, eliminated, 75%) vs. Mike (4-10, eliminated, 25%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.000
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * Justin would guarantee either the #2 or #3 pick with a win
      * Justin leads the all-time series 3-0 and, of course, won in Week 7
      * Patrick takes Justin
         * Tee Higgins or Christian Watson
            * Higgins
               * I guess Higgins has been fine when he's been in there!
               * #35 WR despite having missed five games
               * Caught five touchdowns including two in his last three games
               * I dunno, it just sorta feels like he's not that great? Prove me wrong!
               * At the Titans (2nd)
            * Watson
               * Very inconsistent this year but he still gets looks from Jordan Love
               * Had a solid game last week: four catches on seven targets for 114 yards
               * Just a few weeks ago, he went for 150 yards
               * Hasn't scored a touchdown since Week 6
               * At the Seahawks (18th)
      * Jason takes Mike
         * KaVontae Turpin or Andrei Iosivas
      * Pat projection: Mike
      * Jason prediction
   * Jason (6-8, eliminated, 15%) vs. Schexes (11-3, clinched, 85%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.000
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * Jason has to win to have a shot to pick in the top 4 next year
      * There's absolutely nothing on the line for Schexes this week
      * Schexes lead the all-time series 1-0 and, of course, won in Week 7
      * Jason takes Jason
         * Rashod Bateman or Michael Wilson
      * Patrick takes Schexes
         * Kinda rough over here with injuries, lots of dudes not practicing; they're glad this game matters zero for them!
         * I was getting confused looking at all the possibilities so I'll just give you what's probably a softball
         * Caleb Williams or Jordan Love
            * Williams
               * Super inconsistent this year but certainly capable of going big
               * Four 20-point games on the season including in Weeks 12 and 13
               * Coming off a little bit of a stinker: 17 for 23 for 134 yards and two touchdowns; sounds great but he also took seven sacks
               * Hasn't thrown an interception since Week 6, though maybe that's related to all the sacks he takes (56 on the season)
               * At the Vikings (8th)
            * Love
               * More consistent, for sure; he's almost the opposite player: really doesn't do anything with his feet but very rarely takes sacks (11 on the season; only missed a couple games)
               * He hasn't thrown an interception since Week 11 and he's been in the teens four straight weeks
               * At the Seahawks (14th)
      * Pat projection: Schexes
      * Jason prediction


* High Scorer's Corner: Koci/Mueller
   * APPLAUSE
   * Koci/Mueller scored 222.80
   * 3rd scoring title this season
   * 24th scoring title all-time
