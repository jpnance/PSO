* Game Previews and Risky Player Options for Week 13
   * Anthony (7-5, .238/.450/.045, 48%) vs. Quinn (6-6, .139/.265/.001, 52%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.666
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * New H2H series
      * Patrick takes Anthony
         * Noah Brown or Nick Westbrook-Ikhine
            * Brown
               * Six catches on ten targets for 71 yards last week
               * That was his most targets all year but Jayden Daniels has been giving me a decent stream of work
               * Hosting the Titans (5th)
            * Westbrook-Ikhine
               * It's a trap?
               * Touchdowns in six of the last seven games
               * And he really doesn't get that many targets!
               * Over that seven game stretch: 17 receptions on 30 targets for just 304 yards but six (!!!!) touchdowns
               * At the Commanders (18th)
      * Charles takes Quinn
         * Javonte Williams or Cole Kmet
      * Pat projection: Quinn
      * Charles prediction
   * Justin (6-6, .123/.300/.023, 36%) vs. Schexes (10-2, 1.000/1.000/1.000, 64%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.280
      * Decision interest level: 0.170
      * New H2H series
      * Patrick takes Justin
         * Sam LaPorta or Cade Otton
            * LaPorta
               * Playing on Thanksgiving, if that matters to you
               * Not exactly following up that incredible rookie season very well
               * Still playable, though: three touchdowns on the season and the targets have ticked up a little bit lately
               * Hosting the Bears (14th)
            * Otton
               * He was getting a ton of balls thrown his way by Baker Mayfield in the middle of the season but just three targets this past week
               * Still, maybe that's just an aberration and the #8 tight end will get back to that level of production
               * At the Panthers (32nd)
      * Charles takes Schexes
         * Malik Nabers or Xavier Worthy
      * Pat projection: Schexes
      * Charles prediction

      * Playoff interest level: 0.211
      * Decision interest level: 0.043
      * Keyon leads the all-time series 3-1
      * Charles takes Keyon
         * Anthony Richardson or Brock Purdy
      * Patrick takes Brett
         * Still the most interesting thing on Brett's team
         * C.J. Stroud or Aaron Rodgers
            * Stroud
               * I dunno, he's just sophomore slumping, I guess
               * 20 for 33 for 247 yards, 2 touchdowns, and 2 interceptions last week, which is, roughly speaking, all of his games this year
               * Hasn't been doing much on the ground although he certainly stands a better chance of helping you there than Rodgers
               * At the Jaguars (32nd)
            * Rodgers
               * Still boring and old Aaron Rodgers
               * Basically C.J. Stroud with fewer interceptions and less rushing

      * Pat projection: Keyon
      * Charles prediction
   * Patrick (4-8, .000/.000/.000, 33%) vs. Koci/Mueller (7-5, .518/.648/.255, 67%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.161
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * All-time series tied 10-10 but Koci/Mueller ended a five-game losing streak last year by winning the only matchup
      * Patrick takes Patrick
         * Demario Davis or Jahlani Tavai
            * Davis
               * 23 tackles in his last two games
               * Hosting Matthew Stafford and the Rams
            * Tavai
               * Been pretty good this year
               * Couple of double-digit games a couple of weeks ago
               * Hosting Anthony Richardson and the Colts
      * Charles takes Koci/Mueller

         * C.J. Mosley or T.J. Edwards
            * Mosley
               * Been around forever
               * Been hurt a lot this year, though (imagine that)
               * Practiced in full today so he'll likely be out there on Sunday
               * Hosting Geno Smith and the Seahawks
            * Edwards
               * Very solid on the season
               * Bad game in Week 2 but otherwise hasn't gone any lower than six tackles in a game
               * At Jared Goff and the Lions
      * Pat projection: Mike
      * Charles prediction
