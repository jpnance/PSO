* Game Previews and Risky Player Options for Week 2
   * Keyon (1-0) vs. Schexes (1-0)
      * JAGUAR GAME
      * Still figuring out what's most appropriate here, but:
      * The all-time series is tied 4-4 (hasn't been played since 2011)
      * Patrick takes Keyon
         * Michael Pittman or Brian Thomas
            * Pittman
               * Eight targets but just four catches for 31 yards in Week 1
               * No clue what happened in this game, really, but Anthony Richardson only went 9/19 passing, so you certainly don't like seeing that as a Pittman owner
               * At the Packers (22nd)
            * Thomas
               * Caught all four balls that went his way, including one in the end zone; nice debut for the rookie
               * Hosting the Browns (25th)
      * Charles takes Schexes
         * Caleb Williams or Justin Fields
      * Pat projection: Keyon
      * Charles prediction
   * Koci/Mueller (1-0) vs. Quinn (0-1)
      * Charles, do you remember when Barack Obama was in the White House?
      * Koci/Mueller lead the all-time series 12-1; Quinn hasn't won this game since Week 13 in 2015 (the Obama administration)
      * Charles takes Koci/Mueller
         * Gus Edwards or Raheem Blackshear
      * Patrick takes Quinn
         * Ezekiel Elliott or Javonte Williams
            * Elliott
               * First game back with the Cowboys since 2022 went fine: ten carries for 40 yards and a touchdown
               * Dowdle got eight carries but was way worse
               * Didn't take much on the ground because the Browns were so bad against the pass
               * Hosting the Saints (1st)
            * Williams
               * In a competitive game, Williams got just eight carries for just 23 yards; he was outrushed (and outcaught) by Jaleel McLaughlin
               * Can't like seeing that early on
               * Hosting the Steelers (8th)
      * Pat projection: Koci/Mueller
      * Charles prediction
   * Jason (0-1) vs. Anthony (1-0)
      * New H2H series, of course
      * Patrick takes Jason
         * I'm sorta figuring that CMC gets back in there this week
         * Based on where he currently has the lineup, I think Jason's closest decision would come down to this:
         * DK Metcalf or Ray-Ray McCloud
            * Metcalf
               * Obviously, you love the pedigree but in a competitive game the whole way last week, DK only saw four targets for three catches and 29 yards
               * It's totally possible that it's just gonna fluctuate between the big three receivers they have, so you just have to make a call this week
               * At the Patriots (4th)
            * McCloud
               * In Week 1, seven targets and four catches for 52 yards to go on top of a couple of kickoff returns for 56 yards, all coming out to 8.00 points
               * Our conventional wisdom has been that kick return points are fairly stable but who knows how true that is with these new kickoff rules
               * At the Eagles (31st)
      * Charles takes Anthony
         * Dalton Schultz or Evan Engram
      * Pat projection: Jason
      * Charles prediction
   * Patrick (1-0) vs. Luke (0-1)
      * JAGUAR GAME
      * Luke leads the all-time series 12-10 and has won eight of the last ten meetings
      * Patrick takes Patrick
         * George Pickens or Zack Moss
            * Pickens
               * Pretty good last week!
               * Six catches on seven targets for 85 yards; no touchdown
               * Not clear at the moment whether it'll be Fields or Wilson out there this weekend, depending on how much you care
               * At the Broncos (12th)
            * Moss
               * Got in the end zone last week: nine carries for 44 yards and a score, along with another 17 yards through the air for a total north of 12
               * Definitely was the preferred running back for the Bengals in Week 1
               * At the Chiefs (16th)
      * Charles takes Luke
         * Wan'Dale Robinson or Allen Lazard
      * THE BENGALS RAN 48 PLAYS LOL
      * Pat projection: Patrick
      * Charles prediction
   * Mike (0-1) vs. Brett (1-0)
      * The all-time series is tied 1-1 and the split their two games against each other last year
      * Charles takes Mike
         * Quay Walker or C.J. Mosley
      * Patrick takes Brett
         * Terry McLaurin or Tank Dell
            * McLaurin
               * Last week, seven of Jayden Daniel's seventeen completions went to running backs, which didn't leave much for the WRs
               * Two catches on four targets for 17 yards for Terry; seems like old times with Sam Howell
               * The good news, though, is that none of the other WRs did anything either so hopefully that's just a bad week at the office
               * Hosting the Giants (21st)
            * Dell
               * C.J. Stroud did a good job of spreading it around and Dell even got seven targets but only turned it into three catches and 40 yards
               * Stefon Diggs surprised me a little bit, for sure, and I think I'd be a little scared that Dell is third in line in that WR room now
               * Hosting the Bears (3rd)
      * Pat projection: Mike
      * Charles prediction
   * Justin (0-1) vs. Mitch (0-1)
      * Mitch leads the all-time series 2-1 but Justin won the only meeting last year
      * Charles takes Justin
         * Gabe Davis or Jalen McMillan
      * Patrick takes Mitch
         * Jerry Jeudy or Joshua Palmer
            * Jeudy
               * Decent game last week owing mainly to a touchdown: just three catches on eight targets for 25 yards and the score
               * The quarterback there threw a ton of balls to a lot of different players so I guess you like that Jeudy received a good amount of the attention
               * At the Jaguars (26th)
            * Palmer
               * Just two catches on four targets for 15 yards in Week 1
               * None of the Chargers WRs really got anything done but Ladd McConkey is the one of them who ended up scoring
               * They'll all give it another shot in Charlotte this week
               * At the Panthers (13th)
      * Pat projection: Justin
      * Charles prediction


* High Scorer's Corner: Keyon
   * APPLAUSE
   * Keyon scored 182.72
   * 1st scoring title this season
   * 31st scoring title all-time (1st? 2nd? Who knows?)
