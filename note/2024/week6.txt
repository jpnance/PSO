* Game Previews and Risky Player Options for Week 6
   * Sorry, y'all, no high-level stats this week but The Simulator will be making its debut just two weeks from now, so look forward to that!
   * Schexes (4-1) vs. Anthony (3-2)
      * New H2H series no matter how you slice it!
      * Charles takes Schexes
         * Justin Fields or Caleb Williams
      * Patrick takes Anthony
         * Man, there is nothing here
         * Quinyon Mitchell or L'Jarius Sneed
            * Mitchell
               * Rookie first-round pick by the Eagles
               * Getting a lot of snaps lately and he's been producing decently
               * Hosting whoever's playing quarterback for the Browns
            * Sneed
               * He hasn't been great and I don't think I need to say any more about him
               * This is all there was
               * Hosting whoever's playing quarterback for the Colts
      * Pat projection: Schexes
      * Charles prediction
   * Luke (4-1) vs. Quinn (1-4)
      * Quinn leads the all-time series 7-4 but the results have alternated seven straight times dating back to Week 11 of 2017; Quinn won most recently!
      * Charles takes Luke
         * Ladd McConkey or Allen Lazard
      * Patrick takes Quinn
         * Chris Olave or Christian Kirk
            * Olave
               * Pretty sure I offered this one earlier this season but I think this is closer
               * Derek Carr is down for a while with a torn oblique and thus begins the Spencer Rattler era in New Orleans
               * Olave is definitely the chalk pick but you have to be at least a little concerned with the QB situation
               * Hosting the Buccaneers (23rd)
            * Kirk
               * He's kinda come around lately as Trevor Lawrence has kinda come around lately
               * Basically eight or more points in each of the last three games
               * Tough matchup, though!
               * Going to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium to play the Bears (6th)
      * Pat projection: Quinn
      * Charles prediction
   * Patrick (3-2) vs. Mike (2-3)
      * Patrick won the only meeting between these two owners
      * Patrick takes Patrick
         * Tired of asking about the same guys so let's be sure we get a DL in here
         * Harold Landry or Zach Allen
            * Landry
               * Good season so far!
               * In four games: four sacks, eighteen tackles, nothing wrong with that!
               * Hosting whoever's playing quarterback for the Colts
            * Allen
               * Also a good season so far!
               * In five games: three sacks, 21 tackles, nothing wrong with that, either!
               * Hosting Justin Herbert (who is apparently limited in practice…) and the Chargers
      * Charles takes Mike
         * Tyler Allgeier or Jaleel McLaughlin
      * Pat projection: Patrick
      * Charles prediction
   * Koci/Mueller (3-2) vs. Justin (2-3)
      * The all-time series is tied 1-1; Koci/Mueller won the only meeting last year
      * Charles takes Koci/Mueller
         * Kyle Pitts or Chig Okonkwo
      * Patrick takes Justin
         * Gabe Davis or Cade Otton
            * Davis
               * Last year, Gabe Davis was a boom-or-bust guy
               * Lately, he's really just been a bust guy
               * 3.40 points combined in the last three games, which includes one game in which he went slightly negative and another (the most recent) in which he lost a fumble
               * Been bad!
               * Going to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium to play the Bears (6th)
               * …but he's not a tight end the way that Cade Otton is!
            * Otton
               * Rough start: just 0.1 points from his first two games
               * Since then, it's been a little better but, you know, he's topped out at 5.70 points
               * Also not great, obviously
               * At the Saints (22nd)
      * Pat projection: Koci/Mueller
      * Charles prediction
   * Keyon (4-1) vs. Mitch (0-5)
      * Keyon leads the all-time series 11-5; Keyon won the most recent meeting but Mitch has won the two prior to that
      * Charles takes Keyon
         * David Montgomery or Chuba Hubbard
      * Patrick takes Mitch
         * Buckle your seatbelt because it's time to talk about Keenan Allen
         * Keenan Allen or Tre Tucker
            * Allen
               * Had his best game last week: 3.3 points; and that was his best game of the three that he's played this year
               * Just not remotely on the same page with Caleb Williams right now
               * Maybe it'll get better with the matchup
               * Going to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium to play the Jaguars (30th)
            * Tucker
               * He's been getting double-duty lately both in the offense and as a kick returner
               * It didn't work out great for him last week (only scored 3.6 points) but he was in double digits both of the previous two weeks
               * His worst game is less than half a point worse than Keenan Allen's best game this year
               * Hosting the Steelers (11th)
      * Pat projection: Keyon
      * Charles prediction
   * Brett (2-3) vs. Jason (2-3)
      * Jason leads the all-time series 4-1
      * Patrick takes Brett
         * Couldn't resist
         * Bo Nix or Aaron Rodgers
            * Nix
               * We know he doesn't throw down the field
               * In fact, I was watching a little of the Raiders/Broncos game last week and…
               * That said, basically 20 points in two of his last three games
               * A rushing touchdown in three of his five games this year
               * Hasn't thrown an interception since Week 2
               * Maybe he's starting to get it?
               * Hosting the Chargers (5th)
            * Rodgers
               * Coming off kind of a dreadful game: two touchdowns but three interceptions and three sacks; only 244 yards in a game in which he threw the ball more than fifty times
               * Single digits both of the last two weeks
               * And it's not like it's a great matchup or anything
               * Hosting the Bills (10th)
      * Charles takes Jason
         * Courtland Sutton or Ray-Ray McCloud
      * Pat projection: Jason
      * Charles prediction


* High Scorer's Corner: Schexes
   * APPLAUSE
   * Schexes scored 170.31
   * 2nd scoring title this season
   * 19th scoring title all-time
