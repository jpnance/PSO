         * 0-4: 0/23 (.000)
   * Koci/Mueller (3-0) vs. Luke (2-1)
      * Luke leads the all-time series 12-11 but Koci/Mueller swept both meetings last year
      * Patrick takes Koci/Mueller
         * Not much to pick from here so:
         * Chig Okonkwo or Kyle Pitts
            * Okonkwo
               * Caught a touchdown in Week 1 but hasn't otherwise done anything
               * Not gonna belabor this
               * At the Dolphins (11th)
            * Pitts
               * Also caught a touchdown in Week 1 and has sort of done some stuff since
               * 59 receiving yards last week, neat
               * Hosting the Saints (28th)
      * Charles takes Luke
         * Hunter Henry or Colby Parkinson
      * Pat projection: Koci/Mueller
      * Charles prediction
   * Patrick (2-1) vs. Schexes (2-1)
      * JAGUAR GAME
      * Schexes lead the all-time series 5-3, which makes me feel way better about my significantly worse record against just Schex
      * Patrick takes Patrick
         * I guess it sorta seems clear now that Zack Moss should just be in my lineup?
         * This one feels weird but:
         * Rachaad White or George Pickens
            * White
               * Carries have gone from 15 to 10 to 6 and he's rushed for a low average in all three games so far
               * One maybe speckle of good news for him is that Bucky Irving missed practice today, so he could have the backfield all to himself on Sunday
               * Hosting the Eagles (12th)
            * Pickens
               * Gets a good number of targets and catches but just doesn't do anything with them
               * On the season: 13 catches on 18 targets for just 171 yards and no touchdowns
               * At the Colts (28th)
      * Charles takes Schexes
         * Dalton Kincaid or Brock Bowers
      * Pat projection: Patrick
      * Charles prediction
   * Mike (1-2) vs. Keyon (2-1)
      * Mike won the only meeting between these two franchises last season
      * Patrick takes Mike
         * Tee Higgins or Andrei Iosivas
            * Higgins
               * Made it into his first game in Week 3: three catches on six targets for 39 yards, no touchdown
               * Wasn't that impressive, in general, last year, though he did have a few good games
               * At the Panthers (21st)
            * Iosivas
               * Caught a couple touchdowns in Week 2 against the Chiefs and then followed it up last week with five catches on seven targets for 52 yards and another touchdown against the Commanders
               * Good production and opportunity for the second-year player
               * At the Panthers (21st)
      * Charles takes Keyon
         * Rome Odunze or Tyreek Hill
      * Pat projection: Keyon
      * Charles prediction
   * Justin (1-2) vs. Anthony (2-1)
      * New H2H series
      * Patrick takes Justin
         * This all kind of assumes AJ Brown misses his third straight game
         * Xavier Legette or Gabe Davis
            * Legette
               * Not involved much yet this season: six catches on ten targets for 77 yards
               * Adam Thielen is on IR, though, so there will be more opportunity for everyone else on the Panthers
               * Hosting the Bengals (9th)
            * Davis
               * Rough game in Week 3: two catches on six targets for just three yards receiving
               * Fantasy totals have gotten worse each week so far as the Jaguars passing offense just does not look good
               * At the Texans (23rd)
      * Charles takes Anthony
         * Dalton Schultz or Brenton Strange
      * Pat projection: Anthony
      * Charles prediction
   * Jason (1-2) vs. Quinn (1-2)
      * Jason leads the all-time series 3-2 but they've only ever alternated results and Jason won the most recent meeting
      * Patrick takes Jason
         * Courtland Sutton or Michael Wilson
            * Sutton
               * Decent day last week: seven catches on eleven targets for 68 yards; not quite nice but pretty good
               * That's actually his second game seeing double-digit targets so you like the opportunity that Bo Nix is giving him
               * You'd love to see him get in the end zone one of these days, though
               * At the Jets (15th)
            * Wilson
               * Appears to be the WR2 in Arizona
               * Last week: eight catches on nine targets for 64 yards, no touchdown
               * That was a huge jump in opportunity after he saw just two targets both of the two weeks
               * Perhaps if Marvin Harrison begins attracting more attention on his side, that opens things up for Wilson
               * Hosting the Commanders (32nd)
      * Charles takes Quinn
         * Dallas Goedert or Cole Kmet
      * Pat projection: Jason
      * Charles prediction
   * Brett (1-2) vs. Mitch (0-3)
      * Mitch leads the all-time series 4-1 and has won the last three in a row
      * Patrick takes Brett
         * Quentin Johnston or Terry McLaurin
            * Johnston
               * Been hot lately! Three touchdowns in the last two weeks
               * Most recently: two catches on two targets for 44 yards and a touchdown
               * After a rookie season in which he failed to reach double-digits in any game, he's got two double-digit games in a row
               * Hosting the Chiefs (14th)
            * McLaurin
               * Doing this again, sadly
               * This wouldn't even have been a question if Terry hadn't had what felt like his first good game in years last week: four catches on six targets for 100 yards and a touchdown
               * Maybe he's turned a bit of a corner with his brand new quarterback and can keep it going
               * At the Cardinals (16th)
      * Charles takes Mitch
         * Cam Akers or Miles Sanders
      * Pat projection: Brett
      * Charles prediction


* High Scorer's Corner: Koci/Mueller
   * APPLAUSE
   * Koci/Mueller scored 146.06
   * 1st scoring title this season
   * 22nd scoring title all-time (WHAT_RANK overall)
