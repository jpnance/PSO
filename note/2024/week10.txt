      * Playoff interest level: 0.400
      * Decision interest level: 0.450
      * New H2H series
      * Patrick takes Patrick
         * It got bleak very quickly
         * Miles Sanders or Jeremy McNichols
            * Sanders
               * Gets a few carries and a few targets every game, so he's out there, I guess
               * That said, our guy Jonathan Brooks seems ready to make his season debut this season, so that may complicate things
               * In Munich to play the Giants (15th)
            * McNichols
               * No clue who this is but he got eight carries last week and, in fact, he's had four games this season getting at least seven carries!
               * Brian Robinson is limited in practice; you may care about that or not at your leisure
               * Hosting the Steelers (9th)
      * Charles takes Anthony
         * Calvin Ridley or Nick Westbrook-Ikhine

      * Decision interest level: 0.398
      * Brett leads the all-time series 2-1 and won the last two in a row
      * Charles takes Justin
         * Jaylen Waddle or Xavier Legette
      * Patrick takes Brett
         * Bo Nix should still just be in there!
         * C.J. Stroud or Aaron Rodgers
            * Stroud
               * Rough stretch over the last three weeks: 1 points, 10 points, and most recently 3 points
               * He's had decent games but he's really only had one great game all season
               * Hosting the Lions (13th)
            * Rodgers
               * Decent-to-good for the last four weeks
               * Jets are still hilarious but Rodgers seems decent
               * At the Cardinals (21st)
      * Pat projection: Brett
      * Charles prediction
   * Koci/Mueller (6-3, .607/.760/.515, 38%) vs. Keyon (7-2, .981/.998/.954, 62%)

         * DeVonta Smith or CeeDee Lamb
      * Patrick takes Keyon
         * Tyrone Tracy or Aaron Jones
            * Tracy
               * Devin Singletary's been back for a couple of weeks but Tracy has maintained the bulk of the carries
               * 36 carries over the last two weeks, so you certainly like that
               * At the Panthers (32nd)
            * Jones
               * Only two rushing touchdowns all season but 40 carries over the past two weeks
               * Hasn't been especially efficient with the work lately: basically 3 YPC
               * At the Jaguars (27th)
      * Pat projection: Koci/Mueller
      * Charles prediction
   * Mike (4-5, .004/.013/.001, 20%) vs. Schexes (7-2, .989/.995/.964, 80%)

      * Decision interest level: 0.323
      * New H2H series
      * Patrick takes Mike
         * Roster sucks and also has a ton of Bengals, who are playing tonight, so this is all there is
         * Kyle Dugger or Jessie Bates
            * Dugger
               * Didn't practice Wednesday
               * Hasn't played since Week 7
               * Been pretty good, though!
               * At Caleb Williams and the Bears
            * Bates
               * Best fantasy DB
               * Just pick him
               * I'll hope that Dugger misses the game and this will be a push
               * At Derek Carr and the Saints
      * Charles takes Schexes
         * Malik Nabers or DeAndre Hopkins
      * Pat projection: Schexes
      * Charles prediction
   * Luke (6-3, .872/.912/.737, 77%) vs. Jason (3-6, .002/.007/.000, 23%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.274

      * Luke leads the all-time series 2-1 and has won the last two in a row
      * Charles takes Luke
         * Kyler Murray or Baker Mayfield
      * Patrick takes Jason
         * Kalif Raymond or Michael Wilson
            * Raymond
               * 12 points in Week 8, 32 points in Week 9, 0 points in Week 10
               * He's sort of in the offense but he also still gets all the return duties, so that certainly helps his points out
               * At the Texans (28th)
            * Wilson
               * A steadier player who's in the offense far more consistently
               * He's also coming off a 0-point dude of a game but, even though he has yet to break into double digits, he's got a bunch of 6, 7, 8, and 9-point games
               * Seems impossible but he has touchdowns in three different games this year and, yet, has not broken double digits
               * Hosting the Jets (5th)
      * Pat projection: Jason
      * Charles prediction
   * Quinn (4-5, .236/.251/.079, 92%) vs. Mitch (0-9, .000/.000/.000, 9%)

      * Mitch leads the all-time series 10-2 and has won the last eight in a row
      * Charles takes Quinn
         * Jalen Tolbert or Sterling Shepard
      * Patrick takes Mitch
         * Tutu Atwell or Ty Johnson
            * Atwell
               * Just two catches on five targets for 34 yards over his last two games
               * Kupp and Nacua are both back so there's only so much to go around, I guess
               * Hosting the Dolphins (3rd)
            * Johnson
               * Not Atwell's teammate Tyler Johnson but rather Ty Johnson, the Bills running back
               * He's no good but he got a few carries last week
               * He has scored three touchdowns on the season, so there you have it
               * At the Colts (17th)
      * Pat projection: Quinn
      * Charles prediction


* High Scorer's Corner: Brett
