      * 211 sweeps in history, 123 splits
      * 2019 is the only year that splits and sweeps were even tied

         * Bryce Young or Taysom Hill
      * Patrick takes Anthony
         * Elijah Moore or Noah Brown
            * Moore
               * Maybe benefiting from the Jameis Winston era?
               * 14 catches on 18 targets for 126 yards over the last two weeks; no touchdowns but you like the usage
               * Hosting the Chargers (4th)
            * Brown
               * Wildly funny Hail Mary touchdown reception in Week 8
               * That play alone represents like half of the points he's scored on the season
               * Things have been looking up lately, though, as he's been on the field for at least 60% of the snaps in four consecutive games
               * At the Giants (16th)
      * Pat projection: Anthony
      * Mitch prediction

      * Patrick takes Quinn
         * Greg Dortch or Darius Slayton
            * Dortch
               * Not very good! Not very involved in the offense!
               * But he does get like two targets a game!
               * He also returns kicks and punts, which is where a decent amount of his points come from
               * Hosting the Bears (9th)
            * Slayton
               * Coming off a good game: four catches on seven targets for 108 yards, although no touchdown in there
               * Hasn't scored a touchdown since Week 5 but he has scored at least 5 points in his last five games
               * Hosting the Commanders (23rd)

      * Patrick takes Patrick
         * Alexander Mattison or Zamir White
            * Mattison
               * Since Zamir White started missing games back in Week 5, Mattison has been pretty good in his stead!
               * 38 fantasy points in that span, including two double-digit games
               * The team says Zamir White is set to get more carries soon, though; not sure how much we're buying into that
               * At the Bengals (14th)
            * White
               * Has not remotely produced like he did at the end of last season but I guess you have to care if the team says he's the nominal starter? Up to you
               * At the Bengals (14th)
      * Mitch takes Jason
         * Patrick Mahomes or Jameis Winston
      * Pat projection: Patrick

      * Patrick takes Keyon
         * David Montgomery or Aaron Jones
            * Montgomery
               * Been really good! A touchdown machine!
               * Played in all the games and scored a touchdown in all but one of them
               * That said, his carries have gone down the last couple weeks: just 9 carries in each of the last two games
               * At the Packers (15th)
            * Jones
               * Been pretty good this year but is coming off a lousy day: 19 carries for just 58 yards and no touchdown
               * That said, he's on the field a lot and they clearly want him to be a workhorse
               * Hosting the Colts (18th)
      * Pat projection: Keyon
      * Mitch prediction
   * Luke (6-2, .943/.962/.864, 80%) vs. Brett (3-5, .003/.009/.001, 20%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.189

      * Patrick takes Luke
         * Jaxon Smith-Njigba or Wan'Dale Robinson
            * Smith-Njigba
               * Coming off six catches on seven targets for 69 yards day
               * It kinda just hasn't been there this year
               * He only has one touchdown and only one double-digit game (not the same game!)
               * He's gotten at least six targets in five consecutive games but he's having trouble turning them in to anything
               * Hosting the Rams (17th)
            * Robinson
               * Basically the same story with Robinson but I think you maybe feel better about his targets
               * Only five targets last week but that was just the second time this season that he's seen fewer than 8 targets
               * Only two touchdowns on the year
               * Hosting the Commanders (23rd)

      * Koci/Mueller lead the all-time series 9-8 and won the Week 1 matchup
      * Patrick takes Koci/Mueller
         * Nothing particularly interesting this week and the team isn't that deep to begin with
         * Reed Blankenship or Jaylon Jones
            * Blankenship
               * Plays for the Eagles
