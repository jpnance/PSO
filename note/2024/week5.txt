* Game Previews and Risky Player Options for Week 5
   * Stats
      * 5-0: 9/11 (.818), but nobody is trying to 5-0 this year
      * 4-1: 25/35 (.714)
      * 3-2: 21/44 (.477)
      * 2-3: 9/49 (.184)
      * 1-4: 0/35 (.000)
      * 0-5: 0/10 (.000)
   * Koci/Mueller (3-1) vs. Anthony (2-2)
      * New H2H series
      * Charles takes Koci/Mueller
         * Maxx Crosby or Carl Granderson
      * Patrick takes Anthony
         * Nothing at all interesting on this roster right now
         * Dalton Schultz or Brenton Strange
            * Schultz
               * Boring tight end who makes a few catches a game and doesn't score zero (sounds better than Mark Andrews at the moment)
               * Hosting the Bills (18th)
            * Strange
               * Boring tight end who makes a few catches a game and doesn't score zero (I'd take either of these guys right now)
               * Hosting the Colts (31st)
      * Pat projection: Anthony
      * Charles prediction
   * Keyon (3-1) vs. Jason (2-2)
      * Keyon leads the all-time series 3-1 and has won the last three in a row
      * Charles takes Keyon
         * Brock Purdy or Andy Dalton
      * Patrick takes Jason
         * Sent something in that I couldn't really use because too many of the players were going tonight
         * So we might as well make sure we get some nominees for the RPO XI at the defensive back position
         * Paulson Adebo or Minkah Fitzpatrick
            * Adebo
               * Two interceptions on the season but also 22 tackles over the last two weeks
               * Seems to play the bulk of the defensive snaps
               * At Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs
            * Fitzpatrick
               * Nothing flashy yet this year but seven or more tackles in three of his four games
               * On the field for the bulk of the snaps
               * Old reliable
               * Hosting Dak Prescott and the Cowboys
      * Pat projection: Keyon
      * Charles prediction
   * Luke (3-1) vs. Justin (2-2)
      * Luke leads the all-time series 2-0
      * Charles takes Luke
         * Josh Downs or Jordan Addison
      * Patrick takes Justin
         * There's basically nothing interesting on Justin's roster if Brian Robinson can't go and he's forced to start Austin Ekeler
         * This will have to suffice
         * Zach Charbonnet or Trey Benson
            * Charbonnet
               * Awesome in his first three games, two of which Kenneth Walker was injured for
               * Wasn't so great last week when Walker came back: just two carries for 15 yards, though five catches on five targets for 39 receiving yards
               * Hosting the Giants (13th)
            * Benson
               * He sucks, don't pick him
               * I mean, he gets carries, I guess; it helps if the Cardinals are losing by a ton
               * Oh, look at that
               * At the 49ers (19th)
      * Pat projection: Luke
      * Charles prediction
   * Patrick (2-2) vs. Brett (2-2)
      * The all-time series is tied 2-2 but Patrick won the only meeting last year
      * Patrick takes Patrick
         * Mark Andrews or Mike Gesicki
            * Andrews
               * Worst contract candidate
               * Flat zeros in both of the last two games
               * He actually outscored Gesicki in Week 4 because Gesicki's one catch somehow went for -9 yards
               * At the Bengals (6th)
            * Gesicki
               * One catch for -9 yards last week
               * Otherwise has been okay: 14 catches on 18 targets for 156 yards
               * My main reluctance to start him is that he'd be the third offensive Bengals in my lineup but I guess all I really care about is whether he can beat Andrews
               * Hosting the Ravens (30th)
      * Charles takes Brett
         * Rhamondre Stevenson or Keon Coleman
      * Pat projection: Patrick
      * Charles prediction
   * Schexes (3-1) vs. Mitch (0-4)
      * New H2H series
      * Charles takes Schexes
         * Kareem Hunt or Khalil Shakir
      * Patrick takes Mitch
         * I don't know where to start with this team
         * I think you kinda have to start both Tre Tucker and Dontayvion Wicks
         * So, uh, how about this:
         * Tyler Lockett or Jerry Jeudy
            * Lockett
               * Banged up but it sorta seems like he'll play
               * He had a bad game in Week 2 but otherwise has at least 46 receiving yards in the other three games
               * He still gets targets and catches, he's mainly just not in the end zone these days
               * Hosting the Giants (16th)
            * Jeudy
               * This is like Jerry Jeudy's best season in a while, I think?
               * And he's still only managing to be in RPOs with whatever remains of Tyler Lockett but, hey, progress is progress
               * Six catches on nine targets for 72 yards last week
               * Hasn't scored since Week 1 but Lockett hasn't scored since last season
               * At the Commanders (32nd)
      * Pat projection: Schexes
      * Charles prediction
   * Mike (1-3) vs. Quinn (1-3)
      * Mike won the only meeting between these teams last year
      * Patrick takes Mike
         * This Bucs/Falcons TNF game is surprisingly annoying for RPOs
         * Jaleel McLaughlin or Jauan Jennings
            * McLaughlin
               * Broncos running game has been a joke so far this season but McLaughlin's been in on that joke
               * 27 carries on the season including nine last week; only 86 yards and one score
               * He's not great
               * Hosting the Raiders (25th)
            * Jennings
               * Had a wild game in Week 3 where he had eleven catches on twelve targets for 175 yards and a hat trick of touchdowns
               * Besides that, though, hasn't done much: 10 catches on 15 targets for 189 yards, no touchdowns
               * He's not bad
               * Hosting the Cardinals (28th)
      * Charles takes Quinn
         * Deshaun Watson or Matthew Stafford
      * Pat projection: Quinn
      * Charles prediction


* High Scorer's Corner: Schexes
   * APPLAUSE
   * Schexes scored 170.63
   * 1st scoring title this season
   * 18th scoring title all-time
