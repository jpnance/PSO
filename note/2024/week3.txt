   * Luke (1-1) vs. Anthony (2-0)
      * New H2H series
      * Patrick takes Luke
         * Ladd McConkey or Jordan Addison
            * McConkey
               * Scored a touchdown in Week 1 but only two catches on four targets for 26 yards in Week 2
               * A second straight game where Justin Herbert just didn't throw the ball very much, which has gotta be troubling for Chargers WR owners
               * At the Steelers (8th)
            * Addison
               * Not practicing today, which is bad, but they go at the same time so you'll have injury protection
               * Got injured in Week 1 and missed last week's game
               * Last year, went for 911 yards and ten touchdowns, so you know he can be a factor in the offense
               * There's really just not much else on Luke's team, sorry
               * Hosting the Texans (23rd)

            * Robinson
               * Played 92% of the snaps

               * He's been out-targeted (by one) by Rashid Shaheed

               * Hosting the Eagles (31st)

               * On the season, just two catches on seven targets for 29 yards (-1 yards receiving last week)
               * Yuck
               * Trevor Lawrence is 26 for 51 out of the gate

               * Maybe you just insist that he'll figure it out?
               * At the Falcons (20th)
            * Freiermuth
               * So here's an alternative

         * Xavier Worthy or Khalil Shakir
      * Pat projection: Schexes
      * Charles prediction
   * Justin (1-1) vs. Jason (0-2)
      * Jason leads the all-time series 2-1 but Justin won the only meeting last year
      * Patrick takes Justin
         * Christian Watson or Jalen McMillan
         * Malik Willis or Daniel Jones

            * Love
               * Had a decent game in Sao Paulo before injuring his MCL on one of the last plays
               * Couple touchdowns, one interception, 260 yards
               * Missed Week 2 but was limited at practice today
               * You'll be injury protected
               * At the Titans (9th)
            * Mayfield
               * 28.66 points in Week 1 were followed up with a decent 13.80 points in Week 2
               * Five passing touchdowns against one interception and he even added a rushing touchdown for fun last week
               * It's wild to say but: Baker Mayfield in the #1 QB entering Week 3
               * Hosting the Broncos (18th)
      * Charles takes Mitch
         * Justin Herbert or Trevor Lawrence

* High Scorer's Corner: Anthony
   * APPLAUSE
   * Anthony scored 206.27
   * 1st scoring title this season
   * 1st scoring title all-time ("last" (whatever that means) overall)
   * Declined to send in a voicemail, preferring instead to let his points do the talking
   * I don't know if you follow the news, Charles, but it's an election year and, as journalists, sometimes we need to just give people what we know and allow them to reach their own conclusions
