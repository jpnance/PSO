* Game Previews and Risky Player Options for Week 7
   * Keyon (5-1) vs. Anthony (3-3)
      * New H2H series
      * Charles takes Keyon
         * Brian Thomas or Jameson Williams
      * Patrick takes Anthony
         * Russell Wilson or Tyler Huntley
            * This only matters if it's clear that Wilson will be the real starter this weekend
            * Wilson
               * Hurt his calf in the run-up to the season and sorta wink wink kinda nudge nudge seems like he's gonna be getting his first start of the year
               * Steelers are strange but Russell was pretty decent last year!
               * Hosting the Jets (3rd)
            * Huntley
               * He's the guy for now, I guess
               * He's not looked great
               * About the best thing you can say about him so far is that he hasn't gone negative
               * At the Colts (24th)
      * Pat projection: Keyon
      * Charles prediction
   * Jason (2-4) vs. Schexes (5-1)
      * New H2H series, sort of!
      * Patrick takes Jason
         * This is goofy because it basically assumes that Jason starts Courtland Sutton and also Cooper Kupp doesn't make it into his game
         * It'll count for RPOs regardless
         * Romeo Doubs or Ray-Ray McCloud
            * Doubs
               * Doubs missed his game a couple weeks ago after getting suspended for something or other by the team, I don't really know
               * Came back with a vengeance in Week 6, though, having by far his best game: just three catches on four targets for 49 yards but two of those catches were advanced into the end zone
               * Hosting the Texans (23rd)
            * McCloud
               * Kind of a boring some-catches/some-return-yards guy
               * It sucks a lot when he loses a fumble the way he did last week but, overall, he's been pretty consistently getting you at least five or six points
               * Hosting the Seahawks (14th)
      * Charles takes Schexes
         * Xavier Worthy or Raheem Mostert
      * Pat projection: Schexes
      * Charles prediction
   * Justin (3-3) vs. Mike (3-3)
      * Justin leads the all-time series 2-0
      * Patrick takes Justin
         * Christian Watson or Xavier Legette
            * Watson
               * Jordan Love threw a bunch of touchdowns last week and Watson caught one, his first since Week 1
               * He's a little banged up and was limited in practice today but it's worth noting that like all the Packers WRs are in that boat
               * Packers play before the Panthers so you'll be injury-protected
               * Hosting the Texans (23rd)
            * Legette
               * Pretty much just Ray-Ray McCloud except he actually scores touchdowns in the offense
               * Scored one last week as well as in Week 4
               * At the Commanders (29th)
      * Charles takes Mike
         * Harrison Butker or Evan McPherson
      * Pat projection: Mike
      * Charles prediction
   * Koci/Mueller (3-3) vs. Brett (3-3)
      * The all-time series is tied 3-3 and has only ever alternated results; Koci/Mueller won the most recent meeting!
      * Charles takes Koci/Mueller
         * Kimani Vidal or Tim Patrick
      * Patrick takes Brett
         * Only thing I could really find that wasn't IDPs
         * Devin Singletary or Antonio Gibson
            * Singletary
               * Missed the last couple of games with a groin injury and he was limited in practice today
               * The Giants play after the Patriots, though, so you may not have injury protection here
               * That said, he's had two good games and two bad games this season and, amusingly, he scored touchdowns but also lost fumbles in both of his good games
               * Hosting the Eagles (13th)
            * Gibson
               * Rhamondre Stevenson missed his game last week, which left the door open for Gibson
               * Unfortunately, that door got pretty emphatically shut by Texans as Gibson only gained 19 yards on 13 carries; he actually had more receiving yards on three catches
               * That said, Stevenson is still banged up so it could be Gibson again this week
               * At Wembley to play the Jaguars (24th)
      * Pat projection: Koci/Mueller
      * Charles prediction
   * Patrick (3-3) vs. Quinn (2-4)
      * Patrick leads the all-time series 8-6 but Quinn has won the last three in a row
      * Patrick takes Patrick
         * It's time
         * It's maybe not really even a call but I just wanted to get this in there while it seems reasonable to do so
         * Patrick Mahomes or Jordan Love
         * That's right, I think Mayfield is *clearly* a starter for me this week!
            * Mahomes
               * I don't know what to say here that everybody doesn't already know
               * The Chiefs are 5-0 this year but Mahomes just is not putting up numbers: 16 is his best game and his second-best game is 12
               * Thankfully, his worst game has still been in double digits but it's obviously not that Patrick Mahomes that I thought I was getting for $350
               * At the 49ers (15th)
            * Love
               * The four games he's played this year have been pretty good
               * Threw four touchdowns last week against just one interception, didn't take a sack
               * He's outscored Mahomes all three weeks they've both played
               * You were probably expecting Mayfield here but the Buccaneers are playing the Ravens, who are a significantly better matchup and also Baker is the #2 quarterback
               * Hosting the Texans (21st)
      * Charles takes Quinn
         * Christian Kirk or Darius Slayton
      * Pat projection: Quinn
      * Charles prediction
   * Luke (4-2) vs. Mitch (0-6)
      * Mitch leads the all-time series 10-6 and has won six of the last seven meetings
      * Charles takes Luke
         * Allen Lazard or Jaxon Smith-Njigba
      * Patrick takes Mitch
         * Mitch has tons of guys who play and that's about as far as I'm willing to go
         * Joshua Palmer or Tre Tucker
            * Palmer
               * I dunno, man, I guess Justin Herbert just sorta doesn't throw much anymore
               * Last week, Palmer got two catches on three targets for 38 yards, which is more or less what he did in the previous game as well
               * He's not good but neither are the Cardinals
               * At the Cardinals (26th)
            * Tucker
               * I thought he was reasonable because of his return floor but that, I guess, is pretty opponent-dependent
               * In the offense last week, no catches on two targets, despite being on the field for 95% of the snaps
               * And that was with Jakobi Meyers missing the game!
               * I think Sean McVay is just kicking touchbacks this week, so that's a problem
               * At the Rams (24th)
      * Pat projection: Luke
      * Charles prediction


* High Scorer's Corner: Schexes
   * APPLAUSE
   * Schexes scored 167.55
   * 3rd scoring title this season
   * 20th scoring title all-time
