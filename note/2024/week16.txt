* Discussion Topic: 2024 Retrospective: 12th through 9th
   * Charles takes Mitch
      * 12th place, 0-15, 21-144
   * Patrick takes Mike
      * 11th place, 4-11, 44-121
      * What worked out
         * Uh, nothing of note, really?
         * I guess he was able to get his trades done in very rapid succession when he decided he was done competing, so he got reasonably good value for everyone
         * Getting that Joe Burrow ($355, 23/24)  contract converted into two first rounders was good
         * Geno Smith ($160, 23/25) was okay, #14 QB, but you're probably not too nuts about that going into next year
      * What didn't
         * Isiah Pacheco ($7, 22/24) gets hurt in Week 3 and doesn't get back into a game until Week 13
         * Brandon Aiyuk ($50, 23/25) was bad and then got ACL'd in Week 7
      * What Mike has to look forward to in 2025
         * One first-rounder: bottom four pick from Koci/Mueller
         * First pick of the second round, though, because he owns Anthony's pick
         * $790 available now, another $100 or so if he ends up cutting Geno Smith
         * Smith and Aiyuk are the only guys who make any real money on this team, so there are otherwise no bad contracts but, at the same time, it doesn't feel like anybody else he has signed is anybody you'd even remotely want to rely on, so Mike will have a lot to do this coming offseason
   * Charles takes Patrick
      * 10th place, 5-10, 67-98
   * Patrick takes Jason
      * 9th place, 6-9, 73-92
      * What worked out
         * James Connor ($60, 24/25) just keeps going: #11 RB
         * Kyren Williams ($6, 23/25), T.J. Watt ($15, 23/25), and Fred Warner ($10, 23/25) all played good enough to fetch Jason a nice sum from Koci/Mueller at the deadline
         * Cooper Rush ($1, 24/25) has actually been decent, believe it or not
      * What didn't
         * Like, just about everything?
         * Christian McCaffrey ($250, 23/25) is a surprise scratch in Week 1 and doesn't end up playing until Week 10; then he sprains his PCL in Week 13 and is put on IR; I guess the 49ers putting him on IR before he disintegrates is something you could say "worked out" for Jason
         * Dak Prescott ($225, 23/25) was playing okay but then suffered a, um, avulsion fracture in his hamstring in Week 9, costing him the rest of his season
         * Gambled on Nick Chubb ($80, 24/26) to go along with Jerome Ford ($15, 23/25), thinking one of them would be playable, but neither really were consistently
         * Same story with Aidan O'Connell ($2, 23/25) and Gardner Minshew ($2, 22/24), but that at least didn't cost anything
      * What Jason has to look forward to in 2025
         * One first rounder: picking 5th; one second rounder: bottom four pick from Luke
         * $570 available now, more if he decides Dak or CMC aren't worth it anymore
         * You could see a universe in which both of those guys seem reasonable at those prices, though, and it's a decent enough start to a team, especially with James Connor in there, too
         * I think Jason stands a great chance to get some more wins next year


* The Fifteenth Decision
   * Keyon Decides that playing Luke in the semifinals gives him his best path to a championship
   * Keyon all-season vs.
      * Koci/Mueller 8-7
      * Luke 9-6
      * Schexes 9-6
   * Keyon last four weeks vs.
      * Koci/Mueller 1-3
      * Luke 2-2
      * Schexes 2-2
   * Numbers
   * Keyon: 60225-39775 (0.602)
Schexes: 39775-60225 (0.398)


   * Keyon: 69458-30542 (0.695)
Luke: 30542-69458 (0.305)


   * Keyon: 54993-45007 (0.550)
Koci/Mueller: 45007-54993 (0.450)


   * Schexes: 62248-37752 (0.622)
Luke: 37752-62248 (0.378)


   * Schexes: 48539-51461 (0.485)
Koci/Mueller: 51461-48539 (0.515)


   * Luke: 40921-59079 (0.409)
Koci/Mueller: 59079-40921 (0.591)
   * Just multiplying probabilities, Keyon wins a title:
   * 40% of the time when he picks Luke
   * 37% of the time when he picks Schexes
   * 28% of the time when he picks Koci/Mueller
   * For as great as Keyon's season has been, it almost feels like he's limping into the playoffs
   * Note from the League Historian
   * The Decision used to be a semifinal curse, as Deciders had a combined 6-21 all-play record in the first nine years. However, since 2019, Deciders are 13-2 in semifinal all-play, and all five Deciders have reached the final. 
   * While eight franchises have been the Decider, there hasn't been a new Decider for seven years. In fact, the last eight Deciders, and 10 of the last 11, are in this year's playoff field (if Schexes and Schex count as the same...).
   * It took Keyon eight years to earn his first Decision, but since then, he's Decided four of the last eight seasons. No other franchise has more than two Decisions total.
   * Best of luck to everyone except Keyon!


   * Game Previews and Risky Player Options for the Semifinals
   * Some facts about the playoff field
   * These are the four best all-play records in the league this year
   * Keyon: 8th all-time
   * Schexes: 10th all-time
   * Koci/Mueller: 40th all-time
   * Luke: 50th all-time
   * Out of 196 total franchise seasons
   * The playoff field collectively have a 472-188 (.715) all-play record, which is significantly up from last year's 427-233 (.647); it's the fourth-best aggregate all-play record for a playoff field in our history, trailing only 2022 (.720), 2015 (.726), and 2021 (.745)
   * Keyon has the season's best all-play record at 129-36 (.782)
   * That's the seventh-best best all-play record in a playoff field
   * Luke has the playoff field's worst all-play record at 106-59 (.642)
   * That's the sixth-best worst all-play record in a playoff field
   * So, even though the quality is up very significantly from last year, I feel like it's still fairly flat. Don't sleep on Luke!
   * #1 Keyon (13-2, 129-36) vs. #3 Luke (10-5, 106-59)
   * Keyon playoff context
   * This is Keyon's eighth playoff appearance and first since 2022
   * Keyon is 6-8 in the playoffs all-time: four 2nd place finishes (2008, 2009, 2020, and 2021), two 3rd place finishes (2015, 2017), and one 4th place finish (2022)
   * Perhaps you've heard that Keyon has never won a championship
   * Luke playoff context
   * This is Luke's sixth playoff appearance and first since 2022
   * Luke is 4-6 in the playoffs all-time: two 2nd place finishes (2011, 2022), two 3rd place finishes (2012, 2018), and one 4th place finish (2010)
   * Luke only seems to make the title game in years that end in the same two numbers so watch out for him in 2033
   * Keyon and Luke have been in the league for a long time and have been no strangers to making the playoffs but this is the first time they've ever met in a playoff game
   * Patrick takes Keyon
   * Brian Thomas or Tyreek Hill
   * Thomas
   * Very nice rookie season in what's been a pretty low-voltage passing offense
   * Currently the #6 WR
   * Last week: ten catches on fourteen targets for 105 yards and two touchdowns
   * Those were his seventh and eighth touchdowns on the season
   * At the Raiders (11th)
   * Hill
   * For the $200, Hill has been lousy this year
   * Played all the games but he's only the #23 WR to show for it
   * The Dolphins have had to play a few different guys at quarterback this year, which contributes
   * Last week: two catches on seven targets for just 36 yards
   * But! He has scored touchdowns in four of his last six games
   * Hosting the 49ers (6th)
   * Charles takes Luke: Trey McBride or Mark Andrews
   * The Decider is 8-6 in the semifinals but has won five in a row!
   * The Simulator has Keyon winning this one 69% of the time
   * Pat projection: Keyon
   * Charles prediction
   * #2 Schexes (12-3, 49%) vs. #4 Koci/Mueller (10-5, 51%)
   * Schexes playoff context
   * This is Schexes' fifth playoff appearance and first since 2011
   * Schexes are 6-2 in the playoffs all-time: two 1st place finishes (2008, 2011), one 2nd place finish (2010), and one 3rd place finish (2009)
   * When the two Schexnayder brothers have co-owned a team together, they have never missed the playoffs
   * Koci/Mueller playoff context
   * This is Koci/Mueller's ninth playoff appearance, the only franchise from last year's playoff field that made it back
   * Koci/Mueller are 11-5 in the playoffs all-time: four 1st place finishes (2009, 2010, 2018, 2023), three 2nd place finishes (2012, 2014, 2019), and one 4th place finish (2015)
   * From their eight prior playoff appearances, they've only lost one semifinal game
   * Koci/Mueller lead this all-time playoff series 1-0, winning in the championship game all the way back in 2010
   * Charles takes Schexes: D'Andre Swift or Khalil Shakir
   * Patrick takes Koci/Mueller
   * There's nothing else, so it's still just this
   * Chig Okonkwo or Kyle Pitts
   * Chig Okonkwo or Kyle Pitts
   * Okonkwo
   * He's been bad this year, although he was good last week: eight catches on ten targets for 59 yards
   * It seems like Mason Rudolph is getting the start for the Titans next week, so select accordingly
   * At the Colts (30th)
   * Pitts
   * He's been less bad than Chig this year, but hasn't really been any good at all since Week 10, and really since Week 8
   * Also gonna be thrown to by a different quarterback as Michael Penix gets his first professional start
   * Hosting the Giants (4th)
   * The Simulator has Koci/Mueller winning this one 51% of the time
   * Pat projection: Koci/Mueller
   * Charles prediction


   * High Scorer's Corner: Koci/Mueller
   * APPLAUSE
   * Koci/Mueller scored 228.93
   * 4th scoring title this season
   * 25th scoring title all-time


   * Co-Host's Final Thoughts


   * Plugs
   * No adds or drops by anybody not in the playoffs
   * For the playoff teams, nothing surrounding transactions has changed
   * Consolation games don't matter: if you're not in the playoffs, congrats, you have no action items!
   * Thanks for sending in RPOs
   * Websites
   * And that is it
   * For Charles, I am Patrick. Good luck with your fantasy in the semifinals! We will talk to you next week!
