         * Eric Kendricks or Nick Bolton
            * Kendricks
               * He's been good like he always is
               * If we had a PSO Hall of Fame, I'd nominate him for it
               * Hosting C.J. Stroud and the Texans
            * Bolton
               * He might not ever recapture that 2022 season he had but he's still pretty good

               * At Josh Allen and the Bills

               * Practiced today after missing the last two games with injury
               * He's been snake-bitten this year but his highest snap percentage on the season is 27, so, you know, you don't like that
               * At the Cowboys (30th)
            * White
               * Sure seems like Alexander Mattison's backup at this point but he did vulture a rushing touchdown last week
               * At the Dolphins (26th)
      * Charles takes Brett
         * T.J. Hockenson or Quentin Johnston

               * Decent linebacker this season
               * Got an interception last week and a sack back in Week 1
               * Nothing flashy but he gets it done
               * Hosting Cooper Rush (or whoever) and the Cowboys
            * Micah Parsons
               * Missed four games with injury but made it back last week to great effect
               * Two sacks and a forced fumble last week
               * He's good!
               * Hosting C.J. Stroud and the Texans
      * Pat projection: Quinn
      * Charles prediction
   * Keyon (8-2, .999/.999/.992, 90%) vs. Jason (3-7, .000/.001/.000, 10%)

         * Courtland Sutton or Tyreek Hill
      * Patrick takes Jason
         * I apologize in advance
         * Gardner Minshew or Cooper Rush
            * Minshew
               * First of all: Go Cougs! Pac-12 championship game next Saturday!
               * Anyway, Minshew lost his job to Aidan O'Connell who then got hurt and is now IR so I guess the 'stache is back
               * He lost his job to Aidan O'Connell, so that should tell you everything you need to know about how good he's been this season
               * At the Dolphins (3rd)
            * Rush
               * When I type in "Cooper" to Sleeper's search bar, he's just barely in the initial drop-down menu you see; he's like the sixth most searched-for person with "Cooper" anywhere in his name
               * He's behind three people I've never heard of: Edgerrin Cooper, Cooper DeJean, and Jonathon Cooper (maybe I've heard of that one?)
               * Anyway, let's just say that his only stat is that he's the sixth most searched-for Cooper so I don't have to tell you about his actual football stats
               * Hosting the Texans (19th)
      * Pat projection: Keyon
      * Charles prediction
   * Luke (7-3, .948/.978/.865, 73%) vs. Justin (5-5, .089/.203/.048, 27%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.177
      * Decision interest level: 0.098
      * Luke leads the all-time series 3-0 and, of course, won back in Week 5
      * Charles takes Luke
         * Travis Etienne or Ladd McConkey
      * Patrick takes Justin
         * As a Tee Higgins employer in another league, I know how frustrating his injury situation has been this season
         * Let's give Justin some advice on a couple of WRs if Higgins misses yet another game
         * Jaylen Waddle or Christian Watson
            * Waddle
               * Two weeks ago, he scored 5.60 on -4 yards receiving and a touchdown
               * Last week, he scored 5.60 the more conventional way: 3 catches on 6 targets for 57 yards; I guess he lost a yard rushing or something
               * It's not been a good season for Waddle; he's been not great and the Dolphins quarterback situation has been a mess
               * Hosting the Raiders (6th)
            * Watson
               * Targets have been going up a little lately: seven last week and six the week before that
               * He's also not been great because Jordan Love is pretty good about spreading the ball around but he's been getting the ball thrown his way
               * At the Bears (2nd)
      * Pat projection: Justin
      * Charles prediction
   * Schexes (8-2, .997/.997/.976, 96%) vs. Mitch (0-10, .000/.000/.000, 4%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.001
      * Decision interest level: 0.014
      * Schexes won the only game in this series back in Week 5
      * Charles takes Schexes
         * Nick Bosa or Khalil Mack
      * Patrick takes Mitch
         * Trevor Lawrence is gonna miss his game this week and tempted as I am to give you backup quarterback Desmond Ridder versus somebody, I just couldn't quite get there
         * Joshua Palmer or Samaje Perine
            * Palmer
               * Doing his deep ball thing to great effect
               * Over the last three weeks, he's made five catches for 171 yards, which is a 34.2 yards per catch average!
               * He even scored a touchdown in Week 9, so he can definitely boom
               * Hosting the Bengals (18th)
            * Perine
               * Doesn't really get carries at all but does factor a bit into the passing game
               * At least two catches in each of the last three games
               * Scored a touchdown in Week 9
               * At the Bills (7th)
      * Pat projection: Schexes
      * Charles prediction


* High Scorer's Corner: Luke
   * APPLAUSE
   * Luke scored 186.24
   * 1st scoring title this season
   * 12th scoring title all-time (WHAT_RANK overall)
