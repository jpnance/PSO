* Discussion Topic: 2024 Retrospective: 8th through 5th
   * Patrick takes Brett
      * 8th place, 6-9, 57-108
      * What worked out
         * Bo Nix ($40, 24/26) is the #9 QB; I've gotten in the habit of saying that he's a better Tim Tebow but he survived very well in the middle part of the season without much rushing, so I think I need to come off that camp; he's just been good, he doesn't take many sacks, the Broncos are probably making the playoffs and there's no real reason to think he can't get better at this point
         * Terry McLaurin ($95, 22/24) finally got a good quarterback and is the #4 WR, and that after scoring 3.90 total points in the first two weeks of the season; I continue to be absolutely certain of two things: the sun will come up tomorrow and Scary Terry will be on Brett's roster next year
         * J.K. Dobbins ($99, 23/24) was pretty good! He got hurt, which, you know, is a thing with him. Before that, though, he scored eight touchdowns in eleven games and just seemed to be a huge beneficiary of Jim Harbaugh's offense
         * Garrett Wilson ($14, 22/24) is the #14 WR and basically started for Brett all season
      * What didn't
         * C.J. Stroud ($30, 23/25); to be clear, $30 for the #18 is good on balance, but has to be one of the most disappointing contracts in the league this season
         * Travis Kelce ($90, 24/25) is the #10 WR, which is bad; just three touchdowns on the season, which is his worst-ever total through seventeen weeks
         * T.J. Hockenson ($57, 23/25) got hurt early and hasn't really been that good since he's gotten back in there; just too much to pay a tight end who isn't very reliable
      * What Brett has to look forward to in 2024
         * One first rounder: fourth overall pick; two second rounders: sixteenth overall and a bottom-two pick from Keyon
         * $703 available now
         * That's a pretty good chunk of money given that he's got Nix and Stroud signed for $70 and my hunch is that he'll be willing to run it back with Kelce at $90
         * He's gonna need more players, of course: RFA rights on Terry McLaurin and J.K. Dobbins will be interesting but I like Brett's spot for the upcoming season
   * Charles takes Quinn
      * 7th place, 7-8, 81-84
   * Patrick takes Justin
      * 6th place, 8-7, 90-75
      * What worked out
         * Jared Goff ($95, 24/26) did not turn into a pumpkin; #7 QB for $95 is an incredible bargain
         * A.J. Brown ($169, 24/26) is the #8 WR, despite missing three games (!); you take that every time
         * Kinda borderline but I think Tony Pollard ($50, 24/26) worked out well, ending up as the #19 RB; he's been a little frustrating but I feel like that contract still looks really good going into next season
         * Also kinda borderline because he got hurt but Kenneth Walker ($25, 22/24) was pretty good, for the most part; it does feel disappointing that he only ends up as the #26 RB but Justin will, at least, have some exciting RFA rights on him
         * Kind of the same exact story with Brian Robinson ($13, 22/24); it seemed like he could've been even better but ends up just being pretty good, for the money
      * What didn't
         * J.J. McCarthy ($20, 24/26) got hurt in preseason and never made it into a game and now we just have to wait and see what the Vikings want to do with Sam Darnold
         * Jaylen Waddle ($75, 24/26) is going to be Justin's main cut candidate in the offseason, I think; finishes as the #48 WR, which deserves more like $5, not $75
         * Christian Watson ($44, 24/26) only costs $44, which is less than $75 but is also the #55 WR, which is worse than #48
      * What Justin has to look forward to in 2024
         * One first rounder: second overall pick; no second rounders
         * $667 available now
         * I think Justin has a really good start with one QB and WR he feels great about, a RB and another WR he feels pretty good about, and seemingly plenty of money along with a great rookie pick to help fill in the holes; I expect Justin to be competitive next season
   * Charles takes Anthony
      * 5th place, 9-6, 85-80


* Game Previews and Risky Player Options for the Championship Round
   * #3 Luke (10-6) vs. #4 Koci/Mueller (10-6)
      * This is Luke's fourth third-place game appearance (2-1)
      * This is Koci/Mueller second third-place game appearance (0-1)
      * Koci/Mueller lead the all-time playoff series 2-0, but…
      * Luke went 2-0 against Koci/Mueller during the regular season, but…
      * Including the playoffs, Koci/Mueller lead this year's head-to-head series 9-7
      * Charles takes Luke: Kyler Murray or Baker Mayfield
      * Patrick takes Koci/Mueller
         * CeeDee Lamb or DeVonta Smith
            * Lamb
               * #6 WR on the season
               * Three straight double-digit games
               * Not practicing today, though
               * At the Eagles (7th)
            * Smith
               * #34 WR but has missed three games
               * Scored touchdowns in two of his last three games but came up empty last week
               * Hosting the Cowboys (25th)
      * The Simulator has Koci/Mueller winning this one 57% of the time
      * Pat projection: Koci/Mueller
      * Charles prediction
   * #1 Keyon (14-2) vs. Schexes (13-3)
      * This is Keyon's fourth championship game appearance (0-3)
      * This is Schexes' fourth championship game appearance (2-1)
      * The all-time playoff series is tied 1-1, Schexes having won in the 2008 championship game; Keyon having won in the 2009 semifinal)
      * Keyon won the regular season meeting between these two franchises back in Week 2
      * Including the playoffs, Keyon leads this year's head-to-head series 10-6
      * Keyon is making his fourth appearance in seventeen years of ownership, which is incredible, but…
      * Schexes are making their fourth appearance in just five years of co-ownership, which is unfathomable
      * Keyon is looking to finally get his name on the Ball of Soaps whereas the Schexnayder brothers are just looking for yet another plaque with their names on it
      * Charles gives Keyon monologue
      * Patrick takes Keyon
         * This is emblematic of how good Keyon's team is
         * Anthony Richardson or Sam Darnold
            * Richardson
               * #23 QB despite flat missing four games with injury and/or suck
               * Since he's been back, though, five straight double-digit games including two in the 20s and one just shy
               * He's still a terrible passer, as the stats will quickly bear out but: five rushing touchdowns his most recent five games can't be ignored
               * At the Giants (24th)
            * Darnold
               * #9 QB on the season; it's been incredible
               * How much money has Sam Darnold made himself this year?
               * Only thrown one interception since Week 10
               * Basically the opposite player of Richardson: no real rushing but his passing stats this season are just plain good
               * Is this really Sam Darnold?
               * Hosting the Packers (1st)
      * Patrick gives Schexes monologue
         * On the Ball of Soaps, the name "Charles Schexnayder" appears twice
         * And yet, I still don't really know how to aggregate your stats, Charles, but I'm getting more confident that I've accidentally found the solution
         * Let me give you some history, though
         * For a while, it was easy for me to think of your brother as having been the primary owner (i.e. the one who did all the work) in those first four years
         * I certainly knew him better than you, so it was a natural association
         * His continued success after he unambiguously became a solo owner in 2012 helped justify that in my mind
         * Schex's record as Schex or Schex/Jeff
            * Regular season: 106-65 (.620)
            * All-play: 1166-704 (.624)
            * Playoffs: 7-5 (six appearances: two championships in 2019 and 2021, one second-place finish in 2013, two third-place finishes in 2014 and 2016, and one fourth-place finish in 2012)
         * Further, your struggles as the owner of the expansion franchise that's now Quinn's and then your tenure with James in the current franchise seemed to justify it further
         * Charles's record as Charles or James/Charles
            * Regular season: 49-80 (.380)
            * All-play: 557-851 (.396)
            * Playoffs: 0-2 (one appearance: fourth place in 2021)
         * But I'll tell you what, man, I'm really rethinking it because even with as good as your brother's stats are by himself, they're even better when he's with you
         * Schexes' record
            * Regular season: 49-22 (.690)
            * All-play: 469-200 (.701)
            * Playoffs: 7-2, including this season (five appearances, two championships in 2008 and 2011, one second-place finish in 2010, one third-place finish in 2009, one pending finish this year)
         * I know it's only against five seasons–so many others have played way more seasons than that
         * And I know you could qualify it by saying, well, y'all were the only non-idiots in the first couple of years (which, to be clear, is a good thing, not a bad thing)
         * But a .690 regular season winning percentage with a .701 all-play are the best, by far
         * This year, the best solution to the data aggregation problem that I had was to consider three distinct slices: "Schex without Charles", "Charles without Schex", and "the Schexnayder brothers together", and it actually seems to work quite well
         * In fact, the only real stat that the co-ownership group doesn't beat Schex solo on is championships (tied at 2) and you and your brother have a chance this weekend to change that
      * Charles takes Schexes: Malik Nabers or Deebo Samuel
      * The Simulator has Keyon winning this one 61% of the time
      * Pat projection: Keyon
      * Charles prediction


* High Scorer's Corner: Keyon
   * APPLAUSE
   * Keyon scored 196.02
