* Game Previews and Risky Player Options for Week 14
   * Luke (9-4, .997/1.000/.996, 32%) vs. Keyon (11-2, clinched, 68%) 431
      * JAGUAR GAME - Whoever wins, wins The Jaguar!
      * Playoff interest level: 0.001
      * Decision interest level: 0.430
      * All-time series is tied 10-10 and Luke has won the last three meetings
      * Patrick takes Luke
         * This doesn't even matter if Ladd McConkey doesn't play but this is pretty much it on offense
         * Jaxon Smith-Njigba or Jordan Addison
            * Smith-Njigba
               * #12 WR on the season, so you like that
               * Last week, four targets, which is his fewest since Week 3
               * Made all four catches for 74 yards, though, so it wasn't a disaster or anything
               * He's been good, especially lately!
               * At the Cardinals (13th)
            * Addison
               * Only four catches on six targets for 54 yards last week
               * On the field for 94% of the snaps, though, which is the second game in a row he's been involved that much
               * He definitely gets his share of looks
               * Hosting the Falcons (26th)
      * Charles takes Keyon
         * George Kittle or David Njoku
      * Pat projection: Keyon
      * Charles prediction
   * Koci/Mueller (8-5, .686/.841/.575, 42%) vs. Schexes (11-2, clinched, 58%) 367
      * Playoff interest level: 0.123
      * Decision interest level: 0.244
      * Koci/Mueller lead the all-time series 3-2 and won the most recent meeting back in 2011
      * Patrick takes Koci/Mueller
         * Might not end up mattering for a couple of different reasons but
         * CeeDee Lamb or DeVonta Smith
            * Lamb
               * Played last week but didn't practice today
               * He's been banged up for several weeks but hasn't missed a game and he'll have an extra day to get healthy this time
               * He's been kinda bad, though
               * Just two catches on six targets for 39 yards against the horrible Giants on Thanksgiving
               * In addition to that extra day before the game this week he also got several extra days of rest after playing on Thanksgiving, so is it concerning that he's not practicing today?
               * Hosting the Bengals (22nd)
            * Smith
               * Missed the last couple of games but practicing in full now
               * Pretty up and down this year; in his last six games, he's either reached double digits or failed to crack three points
               * Maybe you like hearing that Dallas Goedert has missed both practices this week and probably won't be out there on Sunday
               * Hosting the Panthers (11th)
      * Charles takes Schexes
         * Xavier Worthy or Deebo Samuel
      * Pat projection: Koci/Mueller
      * Charles prediction
   * Patrick (4-9, eliminated, 35%) vs. Justin (6-7, .006/.009/.000, 65%) 137
      * Playoff interest level: 0.137
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * Justin leads the all-time series 3-0
      * Patrick takes Patrick
         * Mack Hollins or Adam Thielen
            * Hollins
               * Scored four touchdowns on the season!
               * Last week: one catch on one target for seven yards and a touchdown!
               * He's no Nick Westbrook-Ikhine but he might score a touchdown!
               * At the Rams (25th)
            * Thielen
               * Missed a big chunk of the season with injury but has gotten back out there in the last couple of weeks
               * Nice game last week: eight catches on ten targets for 99 yards and a touchdown
               * Bryce Young looks good? Question mark?
               * How much do you trust that? Or Adam Thielen?
               * At the Eagles (5th)
      * Charles takes Justin
         * Patrick Mahomes or Derek Carr
      * Pat projection: Patrick
      * Charles prediction
   * Anthony (8-5, .311/.366/.085, 80%) vs. Mitch (0-13, eliminated, 20%) 086
      * Playoff interest level: 0.086
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * New H2H series; after this, Anthony will be in the books with everybody in the league!
      * Patrick takes Anthony
         * At this point, I guess you just cover your eyes and keep Westbrook-Ikhine in there
         * Elijah Moore or Calvin Ridley
            * Moore
               * He was getting basically nothing done when the first quarterback for the Browns was out there but since Jameis took over in Week 8, it's been a different story
               * Over that span (five games): 28 catches on 48 targets for 311 yards and a touchdown
               * Most recently: eight catches on fourteen targets for 111 yards and a touchdown
               * At the Steelers (10th)
            * Ridley
               * He was getting a lot of work midseason but it seems to have decreased lately, I suppose with the emergence of Nick Westbrook-Ikhine
               * Anyway, you still figure he'll get good looks and his yards per catch average this season is north of 15
               * Great matchup, too!
               * Hosting the Jaguars (29th)
      * Charles takes Mitch
         * Tyler Lockett or Joshua Palmer
      * Pat projection: Mitch
      * Charles prediction
   * Mike (4-9, eliminated, 39%) vs. Jason (5-8, eliminated, 61%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.000
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * Mike leads the all-time series 2-0
      * Charles takes Mike
         * Demarcus Robinson or Andrei Iosivas
      * Patrick takes Jason
         * We could ask about Cooper Rush and whoever's playing quarterback for the Raiders again
         * Or, Charles, we could have some tragic fun
         * Tyler Conklin or Jerome Ford
            * Conklin
               * He just had his best game since Week 8
               * His stats were: four catches on five targets for 32 yards and that's it
               * He's been significantly worse than that since Week 8
               * Aaron Rodgers is bad but Tyler Conklin exists
               * At the Dolphins (20th)
            * Ford
               * I'm not really sure why Nick Chubb was only on the field for 34% of the snaps last week but Jerome Ford was out there for the other 66%
               * They both got nine carries, so it's not like Ford isn't a factor in the offense
               * In fact, Ford's been rushing the ball pretty lately, averaging over 4.5 yards per carry each of the last two weeks
               * He even gets kickoff return duties!
               * At the Steelers (12th)
      * Pat projection: Jason
      * Charles prediction
   * Brett (6-7, .000/.000/.000, 29%) vs. Quinn (6-7, .000/.000/.000, 71%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.000
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * Brett leads this all-time series 4-1 and won the most recent meeting
      * Patrick takes Brett
         * When one of the quarterbacks is on bye, there's just nothing here anymore
         * Joey Porter or Kool-Aid McKinstry
            * Porter
               * I've noticed this before and I have no clue why it happens but Sleeper consistently projects Porter for 0.00 points, every single week
               * He's a starting cornerback who's on the field a ton and has points in every single game but Sleeper is unaware of the idea that he exists
               * Hosting Jameis Winston and the Browns
            * McKinstry
               * He wasn't getting a lot of consistent run earlier this season but he's been on the field for the overwhelming majority of the defensive snaps in both of the last two games
               * His name isn't really "Kool-Aid", unfortunately
               * But it is Ga'Quincy
               * Ga'Quincy McKinstry!
               * He goes by "Kool-Aid" but has a less cool name as a result!!
               * At Drew Lock and the Giants
      * Charles takes Quinn
         * Mecole Hardman or Sterling Shepard
      * Pat projection: Quinn
      * Charles prediction


* High Scorer's Corner: Schexes
   * APPLAUSE
   * Schexes scored 185.10
   * 4th scoring title this season
   * 21st scoring title all-time
   * Throw to Charles
