               * Six carries last week, ten carries the week before that
               * Averages are good but he doesn't factor into the passing game at all

            * Ekeler
               * Kind of contributes in three different ways: on the ground, through the air, and on special teams
               * His worst game on the season is 3.70 but his second-worst game is 7-flat, so it's really been pretty good
               * Hosting the Cowboys (31st)
            * Pollard
               * Carries have taken a hit in the most recent two weeks: 9 carries in each
               * That's way down from his more usual number that's closer to 20
               * Tyjae Spears was sort of kind of eating into his numbers but Spears didn't practice today and is at significant risk of not playing this week

            * Douglas
               * Been seeing consistent targets from Drake Maye this year
               * At least five targets in each of the last three games

      * Patrick takes Mike
         * Demarcus Robinson or Devaughn Vele
            * Robinson
               * He had two consecutive two-touchdown games a few weeks ago
               * He gets targets, usually four or five, which means he's still only the third option at best on the Rams
               * Hosting the Eagles (6th)
            * Vele
               * Also gets targets! (That's where we're at now, where we mainly just offer guys who get targets and that's all we can say)
               * Four catches for 66 yards last week, so that's pretty decent
               * At the Raiders (5th)

      * Pat projection: Keyon

               * Jerry Jones insists that he's the starter this week
               * Actually pretty decent last week, for him
               * 32 for 55 passing, one touchdown, one interception, five sacks
               * Whatever, it added up to double digits, so you'll take it from him
               * At the Commanders (18th)
            * Minshew
               * Antonio Pierce insists that he's the starter this week
               * Also actually pretty decent last week!
               * 30 for 43 passing, two touchdowns, one interception, three sacks

      * Charles takes Brett
         * Joshua Metellus or Cooper DeJean
      * Patrick takes Mitch
         * Joshua Palmer or Tre Tucker
            * Palmer
               * Not great, been bad for two weeks
               * Whatever, we know who Joshua Palmer is
               * Hosting the Ravens (32nd)
            * Tucker
               * We've had him in the RPOs a good amount this season
               * His numbers are absolutely wild to me
               * He's on the field a ton: 89, 92, 91, 95, 95, it goes on
               * For as much as he's on the field, you would think he would be better than the #72 wide receiver, which is just a touch better than Joshua Palmer, who's on the field significantly less often
               * Anyway, he outscored Joshua Palmer last week
               * Hosting the Broncos (4th)
