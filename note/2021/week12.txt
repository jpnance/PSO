* Game Previews and Risky Player Options for Week 12
   * Rematch week #3!
   * All of these matchups occurred earlier this season in Week 4
   * John/Zach (7-4, .494/.620/.278, 63%) vs. Luke (5-6, .006/.015/.000, 37%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.413
      * Decision interest level: 0.160
      * The all-time series is tied at 8-8; entering this season, John/Zach had won three in a row against Luke but Luke won in Week 4
      * Patrick takes John/Zach
         * Mike Evans is questionable with a back injury so, if he can't go, this is a decision John/Zach will need to make
         * Courtland Sutton or Dallas Goedert
            * Sutton
               * Really slowed down lately
               * Over the last three games: 5 catches for 78 yards and no touchdowns for 8.8 total fantasy points
               * He's not too far removed from a couple of consecutive double-digit games, though
               * Hosting the Chargers (3rd)
            * Goedert
               * Hasn't scored since Week 4 but...
               * 60 or more yards receiving in three of his last five games
               * At least two receptions in every single game this season
               * At the Giants (14th)
      * Charles takes Luke
      * Pat projection: Luke
      * Charles prediction
   * Brett (5-6, .000/.000/.000, 45%) vs. Trevor (5-6, .001/.001/.000, 55%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.451
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * Brett leads the all-time series 2-0, including a win back in Week 4
      * Charles takes Brett
      * Patrick takes Trevor
         * Emmanuel Sanders or Robby Anderson
            * Sanders
               * Hasn't been too good lately: over the last four weeks, he's topped out at 6.5 points and even had a no-catches-on-four-targets zero in there
               * He hasn't gotten in the end zone since Week 5 although he did score twice that day
               * The Bills offense has had some strange games in the past few weeks
               * At the Saints (26th)
            * Anderson
               * What is there to say about Robby Anderson at this point?
               * With Cam Newton behind center, Anderson tied his season high for receptions (5)
               * Unfortunately, those five catches came with just 30 yards and no touchdowns
               * His most yardage in a game is still that Week 1 one-catch-for-57-yards performance
               * At the Dolphins (30th)
      * Pat projection: Trevor
      * Charles prediction
   * Keyon (8-3, .786/.836/.525, 84%) vs. Mitch (5-6, .001/.003/.000, 16%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.304
      * Decision interest level: 0.051
      * Keyon leads this all-time series 9-3 and has won three in a row (and seven of the last eight)
      * Charles takes Keyon
      * Patrick takes Mitch
         * Mitch has a ton of byes and injuries in just the right spots that it's hard to imagine him having any real calls on offense
         * Cory Littleton or Patrick Queen
            * Littleton
               * At least six tackles in four of the last five games
               * The other game was kind of a stinker but, overall, he's putting up acceptable LB numbers
               * At Dak Prescott and the Cowboys
            * Queen
               * Had a tough time getting it going this year but over the last two games has made twelve tackles, one sack, and forced one fumble
               * Hosting Baker Mayfield and the Browns
      * Pat projection: Keyon
      * Charles prediction
   * Patrick (4-7, .000/.000/.000, 19%) vs. James/Charles (8-3, .948/.973/.843, 81%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.025
      * Decision interest level: 0.082
      * James/Charles lead this all-time series 4-3 and have won two in a row and three of the last four
      * Patrick takes Patrick
         * Mike Davis or David Johnson
            * Davis
               * After starting the season scoring at least 6 points in each of the first five games, he's scored 2 or fewer in four of the last five
               * He used to be the "not-a-disaster" guy; who knows what he is now
               * He couldn't even get most of the work last Thursday when Cordarrelle Patterson was held out of the game, instead ceding all the carries to Qadree Ollison
               * He's bad
               * At the Jaguars (16th)
            * Johnson
               * Of the ten fantasy scores David Johnson has posted this year, eight of them start with a 0, 1, 4 or 5 (and, to be clear, none of them are double-digit games)
               * Believe it or not, he's coming off a game in which he received the most carries he has all season: 13!
               * He amassed only 18 yards rushing with them but hey! Double-digit carries!
               * He's still involved in the passing game at least, whatever, who cares
               * Hosting the Jets (32nd)
      * Charles takes James/Charles
      * Pat projection: James/Charles
      * Charles prediction
   * Jason (8-3, .850/.868/.673, 91%) vs. Quinn (2-9, .000/.000/.000, 9%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.019
      * Decision interest level: 0.037
      * Jason won the only matchup in this series back in Week 4
      * Charles takes Jason
      * Patrick takes Quinn
         * Trevor Lawrence or Tyrod Taylor
            * Lawrence
               * Hasn't cracked double-digits in his three November games; hasn't even scored 7 points in that span
               * Over those three games, he's thrown zero touchdowns but also zero interceptions
               * A couple of those games (49ers, Bills) have been against tough defenses although one of them (Colts) wasn't
               * Maybe you think he rebounds this week, though
               * Hosting the Falcons (31st)
            * Taylor
               * In his four games this season (two pre-injury, two post-injury), Tyrod Taylor has played four games: three of them scoring 16.5 or more
               * Over that span, he's only thrown three touchdowns against three interceptions, so what's going on?
               * Well, he's been getting rushing touchdowns! Two last week and three on the season
               * His first game back from injury was a total disaster against the Dolphins but he followed that up with a 19-point day on the road against the Titans last week
               * Hosting the Jets (25th)
      * Pat projection: Jason
      * Charles prediction
   * Koci/Mueller (1-10, .000/.000/.000, 5%) vs. Schex (8-3, .915/.928/.679, 95%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.013
      * Decision interest level: 0.024
      * Koci/Mueller lead this all-time series 9-8 but Schex won in Week 4
      * Patrick takes Koci/Mueller
         * Sammy Watkins or Nico Collins
            * Watkins
               * Generally, he's been, you know, scoring points this season
               * Usually to the tune of 3, 4, or 5 points, but those are points
               * A couple of weeks ago he had a terrible game in which he mainly just lost a fumble but he followed that up with a 4.8-point fantasy game, which is pretty good for Sammy these days
               * Hosting the Browns (14th)
            * Collins
               * He couldn't get anything going against the Titans last week, making only one catch on two targets for nine yards
               * That distribution has not been the norm of late, though, and he'll have a reasonable matchup this week
               * Hosting the Jets (22nd)
      * Charles takes Schex
      * Pat projection: Schex
      * Charles prediction


* Let's Remember Some Guys?
