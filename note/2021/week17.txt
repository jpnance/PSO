* Transactions
   * Free Agency
      * The Fuller transaction makes me think about introducing more RPG elements, like a guy won't re-sign with you if you've traded him away or cut him earlier in the season


* Discussion Topic: 2021 Retrospective: 8th through 5th
   * For every owner, we'll give a little insight into:
      * What worked out
      * What didn't
      * What they have to look forward to in 2022
   * Charles takes Mitch
      * 8th place, 6-9, 55-110
   * Patrick takes Brett
      * 7th place, 7-8, 65-100
      * What worked out
         * Tua Tagovailoa ($32, 20/22) took a solid step forward, I think, averaging 13 points per game, keeping the job the whole season, and the Dolphins not trading midseason for Deshaun Watson
         * Melvin Gordon ($171, 19/21) is someone we both saw as a strong cut candidate in the offseason but he'll end the regular season as a top-20 running back; still probably not quite justifying the price tag but a perfectly playable guy who's a real-life UFA that Brett now has fantasy RFA rights to
         * Keenan Allen ($65, 20/22) still just keeps producing; top-20 WR this season
         * Devin Duvernay ($2, 20/21) ends the regular season as a top-40 wide receiver whose worst game on the season was 4.4 points and hit double-digits several times
      * What didn't
         * Matt Ryan ($125, 21/22) started off wonderfully but hasn't scored even 12 points since November 7th. It's kind of a shame that he was given a two-year deal because Brett may very well have been able to move him for a nice sum at the deadline if he were expiring
         * Zack Moss ($13, 20/22), who was part of a near-deadline Chris Godwin deal has not been impressive at all in the latter part of the season, so Brett is just left hoping he can take a step forward next year
         * Noah Fant ($5, 19/21) got off to a really solid start this season but has almost completely faded into tight end obscurity the last couple months
      * What Brett has to look forward to in 2022
         * $714 is tops in the league; he'll also have the #3, #5, and #7 overall picks
         * He won't be starting with a ton, though: Matt Ryan, Tua Tagovailoa, and Keenan Allen are the core at the moment
         * He's really hoping that Rondale Moore ($8, 21/23) can take a good step forward next season (and that's entirely possible) but he'll certainly be active at the auction this upcoming year
   * Charles takes Trevor
      * 6th place, 7-8, 66-99
   * Patrick takes John/Zach
      * 5th place, 10-5, 115-50
      * What worked out
         * Kirk Cousins ($75, 21/21) had his Kurt moments this season but, as of writing, he is the #8 quarterback in our league, so I've gotta give credit where it's due
         * Nick Chubb ($180, 21/23), even with three games missed, has been a top-ten running back this year
         * CeeDee Lamb ($16, 20/22) has followed up his rookie season very well, turning in a top-ten WR season
         * Rookie-wise, you love what you've seen from Jaylen Waddle ($16, 21/23)--a top-15 WR–and even Elijah Moore ($8, 21/23) came on really well at the end
         * Finally, as usual, John/Zach were able to put together a great set of IDPs comprised almost entirely of post-auction FAAB acquisitions
         * There's other stuff even: Taylor Heinicke, Teddy Bridgewater, Mike Evans all worked out great.
      * What didn't
         * I think, really, the main thing that didn't go right for the champs is that some of their key players started getting banged up down the stretch and just couldn't quite get them over the hump and into the playoffs
         * They specifically didn't have a ton of depth so injuries were always going to disproportionately affect them and when it all came down to a Week 14 matchup against Jason, the firepower just wasn't quite there
      * What John/Zach has to look forward to in 2022
         * $330 available, which is third-lowest in the league
         * They don't have a first round pick but they do have pick #2.5 (17) in the second round
         * Heinicke is the only quarterback they have under contract with a chance of starting next year
         * The core of the team, though, is still pretty strong: Nick Chubb, Kareem Hunt, and D'Andre Swift are all under contract, as are Mike Evans, Courtland Sutton, CeeDee Lamb, Jaylen Waddle, Elijah Moore, and Mark Andrews
         * Really, if they can just find a couple of quarterbacks, it's very easy to see them right back in the playoffs next year


* Game Previews and Risky Player Options for the Championship Round
   * This is the only time all year that we save the best for last
   * #3 Jason vs. #4 James/Charles
      * This is, of course, Jason's first third-place game in PSO history
      * This is James's second and Charles's first third-place game in PSO history
      * Including the playoffs, Jason leads the weekly head-to-head series 9-7 but..
      * James/Charles won the only regular season meeting in Week 6, a game decided by exactly one half of one point
      * Patrick takes Jason
         * Justin Herbert or Jalen Hurts
            * Herbert
               * Been on a heater lately: his low score over the last five games was nearly 16 points, with three 22-point games in that span
               * Winning, losing, it just doesn't matter for Herbert; he's able to put drives together
               * He's the #2 quarterback all season
               * Hosting the Broncos (3rd)
            * Hurts
               * His last-five-games span is nearly as good as Herbert's if not for the one game in New Jersey that he got injured and exited early
               * He might very well be the #1 QB if he hadn't gotten hurt and then subsequently missed a game; as it stands, he's the #5 QB
               * At the Football Team (32nd)
      * Charles takes James/Charles
      * The Simulator has James/Charles as a 56% favorite
      * Pat projection: James/Charles
      * Charles prediction
   * #1 Keyon vs. #2 Schex
      * This is Keyon's fourth-ever title game and second in a row
      * This is Schex's sixth-ever title game and first since 2019
      * Including the playoffs, Keyon leads the weekly head-to-head series 9-7
      * Although it's very tight at the top, these are our two best teams, both in scoring average and all-play record
      * Keyon and Schex have only made the same playoff field three times in our history: 2008, 2009, and now 2021; they've faced off against each other every time
         * 2008: Schex beats Keyon in the title game
         * 2009: Keyon beats Schex in the semifinals
         * 2021: Will Schex win his fourth championship or will Keyon win his first?
      * Patrick gives Keyon monologue
         * I'm not sure anything has really changed for Keyon since one year ago, so I guess I'm just gonna copy, paste, and slightly update last year's notes
         * Keyon was in our league's first two title games
         * His incredible 2018 team went 10-4 but didn't get into the playoffs
         * Success
            * He's now the second winningest team in PSO
            * He added three more weekly scoring titles to his collection and is still second place there
            * He still has the 2nd, 4th, 5th, and now 13th best all-play winning percentages in history
         * But, you know….
            * The 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, and 9th winningest teams all have championships
            * The 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th leading teams in scoring titles all have championships
            * Of course, he still has the best all-play records among owners who have yet to win a championship
         * He's on an incredible five-year run right now: only one below-.600 all-play record, three of them above-.700 and two above .800
         * Over that span he's gone 50-21 (.704) in his regular season games
         * I joked last year that my projections at least gave him a break and didn't say he'd go undefeated; I had him at 12-3 this season, which is exactly where he ended up
         * The Simulator liked him last week and the Simulator likes him again this week
         * In the words of Jeff Probst on the most recent season of "Survivor", "There's one thing left to do: win." 
      * Patrick takes Keyon
         * I think this is the only way that we can help Keyon out
         * If Antonio Brown–questionable with an ankle injury–can't go on Sunday, is it:
         * DeVante Parker or Gabriel Davis
            * Parker
               * We walked about Parker a couple of weeks ago but let's reset
               * He's missed a couple of big stretches over the season but, when he's been in there, he's been pretty good
               * Well, except for last week, where he scored a flat zero, having received no targets
               * That's scary but the game before, he made 4 catches for 68 yards and a touchdown
               * He's averaging 7.5ppg even with that zero
               * At the Titans (31st)
            * Davis
               * Missed last week's game on the COVID Reserve list but, since then, the NFL decided to change the rules and so he's now actually eligible to play this weekend, despite being unvaccinated
               * Before he contracted a deadly airborne virus that's killed millions worldwide while eschewing a safe and effective vaccine that's been freely available for most of the year, he was on a pretty good run!
               * He scored 9, 10.3 and, most recently, 20.5 points in his latest three games
               * He scored a touchdown in each one of those games, though, and two in the most recent one
               * I bring that up as a potential negative because there's not otherwise a ton there if he's not in the end zone
               * Hosting the Falcons (28th)
      * Charles gives Schex monologue
      * Charles takes Schex
      * The Simulator has Keyon as a 53% favorite
      * Pat projection: Keyon
      * Charles prediction


* High Scorer's Corner: Keyon
   * APPLAUSE
   * Keyon scored 179.78 in the semifinals (pretty high but not crazy)
   * "It's going to be bittersweet for me when I beat Schex. I will finally be a PSO champion, but my identity as the league's loveable, hard-luck loser will be gone. I'll just be some guy with a fantasy title. No one cares about the Cubs anymore. No one will care about me anymore. Maybe the story is more interesting if I just never win this thing. Go Schex???"
