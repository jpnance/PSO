* Game Previews and Risky Player Options for Week 3
   * We've had 27 teams start the season 3-0 and 19 of them have made the playoffs (19 / 27 = .703)
   * 48 teams have started 2-1 and 24 of them have made the playoffs (24 / 48 = 0.500)
   * 45 teams have started 1-2 but only 9 of them have made the playoffs (9 / 45 = 0.200)
   * 28 teams have started 0-3 and not a single one of them have made the playoffs
   * These games are once again ordered in terms of total wins and then total points, except in the cases of Quinn and Luke because I just don't know what to think about that game right now
   * John/Zach (1-1) vs. Schex (2-0)
      * John/Zach have scored the third-most points so far
      * Schex has scored the most points so far
      * Schex leads the all-time series 16-4 and has won the last five in a row dating back to Week 3 in 2017
      * Charles takes John/Zach
      * Patrick takes Schex
         * Daniel Jones or Derek Carr
            * Jones
               * 22/32 for 249 yards and a touchdown but really what's propping Jones up so far this year is a rushing touchdown in each of his two games along with over a hundred total rushing yards (95 last week!)
               * Kinda crazy because he only had three career rushing touchdowns coming into the year
               * Hosting the Falcons (32nd)
            * Carr
               * Got a little banged up on Sunday but practiced in full on Wednesday so he should be fine
               * 28/37 for 382 yards and two touchdowns but none of the rushing stuff of Jones
               * Hosting the Dolphins (14th)
      * Pat projection: Schex
      * Charles prediction
   * Mitch (1-1) vs. Jason (2-0)
      * The first Skyline Bowl in PSO history!
      * Charles takes Mitch
      * Patrick takes Jason
         * Lavonte David or Demario Davis
            * David
               * Nineteen total tackles on the year, looking solid so far
               * The Bucs were probably up on the Falcons by too much but they likely won't enjoy as much of a cushion this week
               * At the Rams
            * Davis
               * Bad first week (four tackles for three points) but a stellar second week (12 tackles en route to 13.5 points)
               * He's getting up there in age but he still can put up big numbers
               * At the Patriots
      * Pat projection: Jason
      * Charles prediction
   * Patrick (2-0) vs. Trevor (1-1)
      * Trevor leads the all-time series 9-7, swept the regular season series last year, and also beat Patrick in the third-place game
      * Patrick takes Patrick
         * Hunter Renfrow or D.J. Chark
            * Renfrow
               * Man, you've gotta like what you've seen from Renfrow so far
               * 11 receptions for 127 yards and is also chipping in on punt returns
               * 8.0 and 8.3 points in the first two games
               * Hosting the Dolphins (11th)
            * Chark
               * After a nice Week 1, he had a really lousy Week 2, making just one catch for 19 yards on four targets
               * I don't know what to make of Urban Meyer's Jaguars right now
               * Hosting the Cardinals (22nd)
      * Charles takes Trevor
      * Pat projection: Patrick
      * Charles prediction
   * Keyon (1-1) vs. Quinn (1-1)
      * Quinn leads the all-time series 5-4 but Keyon won the most recent meeting and two out of the last three
      * Patrick takes Keyon
         * I don't actually believe that Clyde Edwards-Helaire is sitting this week so I think it's down to...
         * A.J. Brown or Miles Sanders
            * Brown
               * Last week against the Seahawks, the Titans were bad before they were good but Brown was just always kinda bad
               * Three catches for 43 yards; got a little banged up but should be okay for Sunday
               * Hosting the Colts (29th)
            * Sanders
               * 28 carries this year for 129 yards (4.6 ypc average)
               * He had a tough matchup last week against the 49ers and still did okay, he just hasn't scored a touchdown yet
               * Might have a tough time doing it this week, though
               * At the Cowboys (5th)
      * Charles takes Quinn
      * Pat projection: Keyon
      * Charles prediction
   * Luke (0-2) vs. James/Charles (1-1)
      * Luke leads this all-time series 4-2 but hasn't won since 2018
      * Patrick takes Luke
         * Laviska Shenault or Zack Moss
            * Shenault
               * Like everything in the Jags' offense so far, Shenault has been disappointing
               * Two receptions for -3 yards last week and just 47 total yards on the season (no touchdowns)
               * Hosting the Cardinals (22nd)
            * Moss
               * After being a weird healthy scratch in Week 1, Moss actually makes the team in Week 2 and ends up scoring two touchdowns en route to a 13.4-point day
               * They like giving him the ball when they're close and he gets touches when he's, you know, active
               * Hosting the Football Team (9th)
      * Charles takes James/Charles
      * Pat projection: James/Charles
      * Charles prediction
   * Koci/Mueller (0-2) vs. Brett (0-2)
      * Koci/Mueller haven't started 0-3 since the inaugural season
      * Koci/Mueller and Brett split their season series last year
      * Patrick takes Koci/Mueller
         * Jonnu Smith or Juwan Johnson
            * Smith
               * Looked pretty okay so far: nine catches for 70 yards but no touchdowns
               * Those are totally reasonable TE numbers
               * Hosting the Saints (11th)
            * Johnson
               * WR/TE and I guess he seems more like the TE part of that
               * Four receptions for 44 yards on the year but he scored two touchdowns in Week 1 against the Packers
               * At the Patriots (5th)
      * Charles takes Brett
      * Pat projection: Koci/Mueller
      * Charles prediction
