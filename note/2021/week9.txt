* Game Previews and Risky Player Options for Week 9
   * Rematch week! Week 1 rematches.
   * John/Zach (5-3, .516/.711/.297, 53%) vs. Keyon (6-2, .718/.914/.543, 47%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.433
      * Decision interest level: 0.386
      * Keyon leads the all-time series 11-10 and won in Week 1
      * Patrick takes John/Zach
         * Elijah Moore is playing on TNF and Kenny Golladay still isn't practicing so there's really nothing here on offense
         * Sorry, but it's gonna be IDPs this week
         * Cameron Heyward or Emmanuel Ogbah
            * Heyward
               * 2.5 sacks on the season including 1.5 over the last two games
               * Also gets a fair number of tackles and passes defensed
               * Hosting Justin Fields and Bears
            * Ogbah
               * 2.5 on the season as well but doesn't get nearly as many tackles
               * Hosting Tyrod Taylor (and/or Davis Mills?) and the Texans
      * Charles takes Keyon
      * Pat projection: Keyon
      * Charles prediction
   * James/Charles (6-2, .885/.962/.807, 51%) vs. Schex (6-2, .789/.918/.663, 49%)
      * The family affair!
      * Playoff interest level: 0.213
      * Decision interest level: 0.537
      * Schex leads this all-time 9-2 and won in Week 1
      * Charles takes James/Charles
      * Patrick takes Schex
         * I'm not certain I think this is really a call he's gonna have to make but I guess he may just hate the idea of starting Khalil Herbert
         * James Connor or Jamal Agnew
            * Connor
               * Been great so far this season: 94 carries for 358 yards (3.8 ypc) and 8 touchdowns
               * Six of those touchdowns have come in the last five games
               * He doesn't get like a ton of work but it's obviously enough for him to score some serious points
               * At the 49ers (13th)
            * Agnew
               * Coming off a 6-catch, 38-yard, 1-touchdown performance in Seattle
               * Over the last three games: 17 catches, 157 yards, 1 touchdown
               * Ever since D.J. Chark went down, Agnew has really significantly benefited
               * Hosting the Bills (1st)
      * Pat projection: Schex
      * Charles prediction
   * Trevor (4-4, .027/.038/.008, 64%) vs. Quinn (1-7, .000/.000/.000, 36%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.108
      * Decision interest level: 0.142
      * Trevor leads the all-time series 7-3, won in Week 1, and has won each of the last three meetings
      * Charles takes Trevor
      * Patrick takes Quinn
         * I don't really know what Quinn's gonna do here because he's got Ben Roethlisberger, Trevor Lawrence, and now Tyrod Taylor, returning from injury
         * I guess I think he should clearly start Roethlisberger, which leaves:
         * Trevor Lawrence or Tyrod Taylor
            * Lawrence
               * He's had a pretty good rookie season, I'd say
               * He's completing a little under 60% of his passes, so you'd like to see that go up, he's thrown 8 touchdowns but only 9 interceptions and has only taken 11 sacks.
               * Also got some reasonable rushing numbers.
               * He looks good, he's an asset, but he's also not exactly a no-brainer start if you have another reasonable option, especially this week
               * Hosting the Bills (1st)
            * Taylor
               * Taylor might be that other reasonable option
               * In the first two games of the season, Taylor threw three touchdowns, no interceptions, and even scored a rushing touchdown. He only took one sack and, really, looked like he was cruising against the Browns when he got hurt
               * I know Tyrod Taylor isn't anybody's idea of lighting the world on fire but you've gotta love the matchup
               * At the Dolphins (30th)
      * Pat projection: Trevor
      * Charles prediction
   * Jason (7-1, .977/.980/.932, 93%) vs. Brett (4-4, .001/.007/.001, 7%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.082
      * Decision interest level: 0.021
      * Jason won in Week 1
      * Patrick takes Jason
         * I really tried to make other stuff work but I just couldn't quite do it with a straight face
         * Jalen Hurts or Justin Herbert
            * Hurts
               * Hurts is having a great fantasy season and also is not a great passer and also is a great runner
               * Even though the passing numbers seem a little bad (61.3% completion), he's nevertheless thrown 10 touchdowns against just four interceptions
               * You certainly live with that because, on the ground, he's got 432 yards rushing with five touchdowns
               * Hosting the Chargers (5th)
            * Herbert
               * Herbert is having a good, if not great, follow-up to his wonderful rookie season
               * He's thrown 16 touchdowns to just 6 interceptions and pretty much every PSO team would love to have a Herbert on their roster
               * That said, the past couple of weeks have been tough for him: 10.82 and 9.00 points, respectively, with three touchdowns and three interceptions in that span
               * At the Eagles (9th)
      * Charles takes Brett
      * Pat projection: Jason
      * Charles prediction
   * Koci/Mueller (1-7, .000/.000/.000, 22%) vs. Patrick (3-5, .004/.005/.000, 78%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.064
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * Koci/Mueller lead the all-time series 8-9 but Patrick has won three in a row, including in Week 1
      * Charles takes Koci/Mueller
      * Patrick takes Patrick
         * This is all such a mess but it's possible this ends up being something
         * Jeremy McNichols or Mike Davis
            * McNichols
               * He came to my team as an emergency pick-up a few weeks ago but now may be the nominal starter after Derrick Henry goes down with a foot injury
               * He's only gotten seven carries so far this season but he does have 21 receptions
               * He'll maybe be competing with Adrian Peterson for snaps? Who knows!
               * Anyway, that guy might make my starting lineup
               * At the Rams (17th)
            * Mike Davis
               * He's the king of not having a disaster game
               * He's got one game with 1.0 points and everything else between 6 and 10
               * He's definitely ceded some touches to Cordarrelle Patterson but he still figures to get 15 or so in the game
               * At the Saints (5th)
      * Pat projection: Koci/Mueller
      * Charles prediction
   * Mitch (2-6, .000/.000/.000, 7%) vs. Luke (3-5, .083/.087/.022, 93%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.017
      * Decision interest level: 0.018
      * Mitch leads the all-time series 6-5 and has won the last two in a row, including Week 1
      * Patrick takes Mitch
         * DeVonta Smith or Tim Patrick
            * Smith
               * I sort feel like DeVonta Smith is regarded as a great asset but the numbers tell a somewhat different story
               * 33 catches for 421 yards seems okay but he's only scored one touchdown this season
               * He's coming off a 1-catch-for-15-yards performance in a game where the Eagles scored 44
               * Just two games ago, he had a 2-catch 31-yard day
               * He hasn't scored a touchdown since Week 1
               * Hosting the Chargers (2nd)
            * Patrick
               * Feels like an RPO XI guy for sure to me
               * Patrick's numbers are eerily similar: 30 catches for 424 yards, but he's scored three touchdowns instead of just one
               * He's had a couple of bad games but, overall, has been a very solid option for the lineup
               * At the Cowboys (26th)
      * Charles takes Luke
      * Pat projection: Luke
      * Charles prediction


* High Scorer's Corner: Keyon
   * APPLAUSE
   * Keyon scored 189.68
   * 2nd scoring title this season
   * 27th scoring title all-time (2nd overall)
