* Game Previews and Risky Player Options for Week 10
   * Jason (7-2, .912/.963/.858, 52%) vs. Schex (7-2, .946/.989/.906, 48%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.092
      * Decision interest level: 0.734
      * Jason goes to 54% for The Decision with a win and 6% with a loss
      * Schex goes to 72% for The Decision with a win and 15% with a loss
      * Patrick takes Jason
         * I wanted this to be Dalton Schultz vs. Logan Thomas but the Football Team haven't even designated Thomas to return from IR yet
         * There's otherwise nothing close on offense besides the old standby
         * If there's anywhere we can save a little time, it's here
         * Jalen Hurts or Justin Herbert
            * Hurts
               * Runs for a lot of yards, isn't a great passer, excels in garbage time
               * At the Broncos (3rd)
            * Herbert
               * Passes for a lot of yards, doesn't do much on the ground, excels in shootouts
               * Hosting the Vikings (12th)
      * Charles takes Schex
      * Pat projection: Jason
      * Charles prediction
   * Keyon (6-3, .528/.577/.290, 83%) vs. Brett (5-4, .010/.048/.002, 17%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.266
      * Decision interest level: 0.296
      * Brett won the only meeting between these two regimes last year
      * Patrick takes Keyon
         * Tyler Lockett or Nyheim Hines
            * Lockett
               * Russell Wilson is back this week from his finger injury but...
               * We've talked this a little before: Lockett endured a midseason lull that started before Wilson went out
               * He got out of that funk last week against the Jaguars to the tune of 12 catches for 142 yards (by far his best game since Week 2)
               * But he doesn't get to play the Jags two weeks in a row
               * At the Packers (3rd)
            * Hines
               * Had a great game last week against the Jets, who the Colts absolutely blew out for nearly the entire game: 6 carries for 74 yards
               * Obviously, Jonathan Taylor is having an incredible season, so Hines isn't normally an option you'd consider but:
               * Hines has both KR and PR duties, so he chips in that way
               * It also might be garbage time again
               * Hosting the Jaguars (15th)
      * Charles takes Brett
      * Pat projection: Keyon
      * Charles prediction
   * Luke (3-6, .012/.016/.001, 70%) vs. Trevor (4-5, .006/.016/.001, 30%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.298
      * Decision interest level: 0.250
      * Luke leads the all-time series 10-9 but Trevor won the most recent meeting last season
      * Patrick takes Luke
         * This is a mess but if Claypook doesn't play (and it's not looking good), I think this is the call...
         * Laviska Shenault or Jalen Reagor
            * Shenault
               * Just hasn't gotten much done this season
               * He hasn't scored a single touchdown, he's only got 343 yards on 32 receptions, and he only has one game in double digits
               * He clearly hasn't taken the leap we all wanted him to in his second season but maybe the matchup can help him out
               * At the Colts (31st)
            * Reagor
               * He's sorta the same touchdown-dependent guy that Shenault is but his lows are a lot lower
               * He's only gotten eight targets over the last four games but he has at least scored a couple of touchdowns this year
               * At the Broncos (15th)
      * Charles takes Trevor
      * Pat projection: Trevor
      * Charles prediction
   * Mitch (3-6, .000/.001/.000, 36%) vs. Patrick (4-5, .004/.006/.001, 64%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.318
      * Decision interest level: 0.143
      * The all-time series is tied but Patrick has won the last four meetings in a row, a streak that began in Week 3 of 2017
      * Charles takes Mitch
      * Patrick takes Patrick
         * I think my lineup sets itself, pretty much, but there's a significant chance that James Robinson doesn't play, in which case:
         * Dan Arnold or Randall Cobb
            * Arnold
               * No touchdowns on the season but, over the last two games: 12 catches from 17 targets for 128 yards
               * Been pretty playable, overall
               * At the Colts (25th)
            * Cobb
               * Four touchdowns on the season but he's only scored in two different games
               * He has been getting targets lately, owing to Davante Adams, Allen Lazard, and Aaron Rodgers all missing time with coronavirus
               * Over the last three games: 9 catches from 14 targets for 87 yards and two touchdowns
               * Hosting the Seahawks (21st)
      * Pat projection: Patrick
      * Charles prediction
   * James/Charles (6-3, .823/.831/.669, 95%) vs. Quinn (2-7, .000/.000/.000, 5%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.259
      * Decision interest level: 0.016
      * Quinn leads the all-time series 3-1 but James/Charles won the most recent meeting last year
      * Charles takes James/Charles
      * Patrick takes Quinn
         * This is a total mess but I think it'll come down to…
         * Christian Kirk or Jamison Crowder
            * Kirk
               * He's on a really nice stretch, actually!
               * Over the past four games: 19 catches from 25 targets for 262 yards and two touchdowns! Wow!
               * DeAndre Hopkins is still missing practice so there could be plenty more targets for Kirk
               * Hosting the Panthers (4th)
            * Crowder
               * Not remotely exciting but, you know what? Mike White (and, uh, Josh Johnson!) throw to him!
               * Over the last three games: 17 catches from 22 targets for 156 yards and no touchdowns.
               * Mike White's starting again this week
               * Hosting the Bills (1st)
      * Pat projection: James/Charles
      * Charles prediction
   * John/Zach (6-3, .760/.781/.528, 92%) vs. Koci/Mueller (1-8, .000/.000/.000, 8%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.023
      * Decision interest level: 0.023
      * Koci/Mueller lead the all-time series 10-5 but John/Zach won the only meeting last year
      * Patrick takes John/Zach
         * This is basically the same as Jason's situation so we go with the old stand-by
         * Taylor Heinicke or Teddy Bridgewater
            * Heinicke
               * Heinicke has had a tough four-game stretch: 3 touchdowns to 6 interceptions and a 95-yard rushing game is the only reason why *any* of those four games made it to double digits
               * Football Team are coming off a bye week, though, so maybe he's feeling refreshed
               * Hosting the Buccaneers (20th)
            * Bridgewater
               * Bridgewater has been on a pretty solid four-game stretch: 7 touchdowns to 4 interceptions and he even scored on the ground.
               * Double digits in three of those four games
               * Hosting the Eagles (17th)
      * Charles takes Koci/Mueller
      * Pat projection: Koci/Mueller
      * Charles prediction


* Let's Remember Some Guys?


* High Scorer's Corner: Schex
   * APPLAUSE
   * Schex scored 161.48
   * 3rd scoring title this season
