* Game Previews and Risky Player Options for Week 7
   * Patrick (3-3) vs. Schex (5-1)
      * JAGUAR GAME
      * Schex looking for his second-ever 6-1 start (2019)
      * Patrick looking to end his three-game losing streak after starting the season on a three-game winning streak
      * Schex leads the all-time series 12-6 but Patrick won the most recent meeting
      * Patrick takes Patrick
         * David Johnson or Salvon Ahmed
            * Johnson
               * Averaging three carries and two receptions per game
               * Obviously, with that paltry workload it's tough to get anything going
               * That said, it's not crazy to think that he could score 4 or 5 points
               * At the Cardinals (7th)
            * Ahmed
               * Also averaging three carries but only one reception per game
               * All of his stats are worse than Johnson's except for this one: he most recently received seven carries in a game whereas Johnson most recently received two.
               * Hosting the Falcons (23rd)
      * Charles takes Schex
      * Pat projection: Patrick
      * Charles prediction
   * Jason (5-1) vs. Trevor (3-3)
      * Jason looking to start a new winning streak
      * Trevor looking to extend his winning streak to three
      * First-ever meeting between these regimes
      * Charles takes Jason
      * Patrick takes Trevor
         * This is incredibly stupid but Trevor is just so decimated this week with three starters on bye the only interesting spot is taken by a TNF player so, you're getting IDPs
         * Jayson Oweh or Carlos Dunlap
            * Oweh
               * On the year, Oweh has three sacks, two forced fumbles, and a fumble recovery
               * He's had some nice games but, unfortunately, most recently scored a 0.0
               * Hosting Joe Burrow and the Bengals
            * Dunlap
               * Been a good player for a long time but has struggled to stay on the field this year thanks to a toe injury
               * He's not on the report this week, though
               * Hosting Jameis Winston and the Saints
      * Pat projection: Trevor
      * Charles prediction
   * Keyon (4-2) vs. Luke (3-3)
      * JAGUAR GAME
      * Not clear that Keyon actually wants to win this game but he still might!
      * Luke, meanwhile, is looking for his fourth straight win after starting 0-3
      * Keyon leads the all-time series 8-7 and has won five of the last six meetings
      * Charles takes Keyon
      * Patrick takes Luke
         * Too many Browns and Broncos make this Luke's only remotely close call
         * Jameis Winston or Justin Fields
            * Winston
               * Winston's had good stats this year but he has been all over the place: two games 20+ but also two games 10-
               * He's thrown 12 touchdowns against just 3 interceptions and he even chimes in with some rushing yardage now and again
               * At the Seahawks (18th)
            * Fields
               * Has yet to score 10 points this season but he's maybe getting better: 6.2, 6.8, then, most recently, 9.3
               * The rushing numbers seem really solid so far, he just needs to get it going with his arm a little more
               * At the Buccaneers (26th)
      * Pat projection: Keyon
      * Charles prediction
   * John/Zach (4-2) vs. Mitch (2-4)
      * John/Zach seem like they're going for it now and would very much like to start 5-2, which is exactly where they found themselves last year after seven weeks
      * Mitch is just looking for any win he can get in order to improve his draft position
      * Mitch leads the all-time series 8-5 but has last the last three in a row
      * Patrick takes John/Zach
         * At least one of these guys really seems like they're gonna sit this week but this is all there is on the roster this week, thanks to byes and TNF
         * Kenny Golladay or Dallas Goedert
            * Golladay
               * Didn't play last week and hasn't practiced since
               * He's been, I dunno, playable when he's been in there, with 17 receptions for 282 yards; he mainly just hasn't gotten into the end zone
               * If he plays and, say, Saquon Barkley and Kadarious Toney, don't, he's pretty much all there is
               * He plays before Dallas Goedert so you'll have injury protection
               * Hosting the Panthers (15th)
            * Goedert
               * Just activated off the COVID list but didn't practice on Thursday
               * Nobody seems to really know what that's about but I guess it doesn't seem to be injury-related
               * He's been pretty good for a tight end: 15 catches for 216 yards and two touchdowns
               * At the Raiders (27th)
      * Charles takes Mitch
      * Pat projection: Mitch
      * Charles prediction
   * Koci/Mueller (0-6) vs. James/Charles (4-2)
      * James is looking for his first 5-2 start since 2016, the year before he hired you; Charles, you are looking for your first 5-2 start since you had sole ownership of an expansion franchise in back in 2012
      * Koci/Mueller are just looking for anything at all
      * Koci/Mueller lead the all-time series 5-2 and have won the last four in a row
      * Patrick takes Koci/Mueller
         * The Surnamers have to start Taysom Hill in their QB slot
         * Byron Pringle or Sammy Watkins
            * Pringle
               * With a limited workload, Pringle's really been pretty good: 12 catches for 170 yards and two touchdowns
               * He doesn't get much but he always does seem to get several targets a game and he does a good job making them count
               * At the Titans (32nd)
            * Watkins
               * Get this, Sammy Watkins is banged up: missed practice today with a thigh injury
               * His peripherals are better than Pringles (18 catches for 292 yards) but he has yet to find the end zone this season
               * He's topped out at four catches in a game this season but he gets consistent work when he's in there
               * Hosting the Bengals (9th)
      * Charles takes James/Charles
      * Pat projection: James/Charles
      * Charles prediction
   * Brett (2-4) vs. Quinn (1-5)
      * Brett is looking to avoid his third loss in a row
      * Quinn is looking to avoid his fifth loss in a row
      * Charles takes Brett
      * Patrick takes Quinn
         * I'm not sure if this is really the call but it could be and I just couldn't resist!
         * Jamison Crowder or Christian Kirk
            * Crowder
               * In two games, Crowder has 11 catches for 85 yards and a touchdown
               * I dunno, seems acceptable? He's as good as anyone else on the Jets, right? Especially Denzel Mims?
               * At the Patriots (17th)
            * Kirk
               * Coming off a nice game scoring 13.5 points on 5 catches for 75 yards and a touchdown
               * This season, he's had three games in double-digits, two games scoring like five points, and only one total 0.5-point stinker
               * Looks like a guy to me; that said:
               * Hosting the Texans (4th)
      * Pat projection: Brett
      * Charles prediction
