      * Huge leverage game for both teams
      * John leads the all-time series 5-4 and has won two straight meetings, including back in Week 5
      * Patrick takes John/Zach
         * Sorta feels like neither of these guys is gonna play
         * Submitted: Dallas Goedert or Lativius Murray
            * Goedert
               * Got concussed in the previous game but was limited at practice today
               * Been quiet the last two weeks: 5 catches for 71 yards (no touchdowns)
               * Was great the two weeks before that, though: 9 catches for 142 yards (no touchdowns)
               * It's been a little while since he scored a touchdown but you know he'll get back into the end zone soon enough
               * Hosting the Saints (3rd)
            * Murray
               * Has an ankle injury but was limited in practice today
               * Hasn't played since Week 6
               * When he's been in there, he's been pretty touchdown-dependent
               * He doesn't usually get a ton of carries and he's only averaged 3.6ypc but he has scored four touchdowns in the six games he's played
               * At the Bears (20th)
      * Charles takes James/Charles
      * Pat projection: James/Charles
      * Charles prediction

      * Jason won the first-ever meeting between these two franchise back in Week 5
      * Patrick takes Keyon
         * Submitted: Tyler Lockett or DeAndre Carter
            * Lockett
               * We know Tyler Lockett
               * Great start, sucked for a couple months, then had a good game against the Jags
               * Well the Seahawks were dreadful all around against the Packers but Lockett only made two catches on eight targets for 23 yards
               * He's had another game like that this season but, overall, when he's gotten targets, he's produced, so it's a matter of if you think he'll rebound this week or not
               * Hosting the Cardinals (11th)
            * Carter
               * Over the last two weeks, Carter has made six catches on twelve targets for 107 yards and two touchdowns
               * Pretty good numbers on their own
               * He also returns kicks and punts, though, giving him a few bonus points every week
               * In fact, he's played in all nine games this season and has four double-digit performances
               * At the Panthers (2nd)
      * Charles takes Jason
      * Pat projection: Jason
      * Charles prediction
   * Luke (4-6, .013/.019/.001, 67%) vs. Patrick (4-6, .000/.001/.000, 33%)
      * JAGUAR GAME
      * Playoff interest level: 0.369
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * Patrick must win by more than 15.37 to keep his Jaguar hopes alive
      * The all-time series is tied 9-9 but Luke has won five of the last six meetings, including back in Week 5
      * Charles takes Luke
      * Patrick takes Patrick
         * Dan Arnold or Randall Cobb
            * Arnold
               * Really gotten it going lately
               * Despite scoring no touchdowns, over the last five games, he's made 25 catches on 37 targets for 212 yards
               * Pretty evenly distributed, too: four of those five games were 60+ yards receiving
               * Hosting the 49ers (10th)
            * Cobb
               * Nothing's changed, really
               * He gets four or five looks every game, makes three catches every game, and scores either zero or two touchdowns
               * The only thing that's maybe a little different this week is the matchup
               * At the Vikings (25th)
      * Pat projection: Patrick
      * Charles prediction
   * Brett (5-5, .001/.006/.000, 12%) vs. Schex (7-3, .911/.935/.731, 88%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.204
      * Decision interest level: 0.042
      * Schex leads the short all-time series 3-0
      * Patrick takes Brett
         * Submitted: Rondale Moore or Devin Duvernay
            * Moore
               * He's had three games in double-digits this year but none since Week 5
               * It's been grim since then: 15 catches on 21 targets for just 92 yards and no touchdowns
               * It's not all Colt, either; he was plenty bad with Kyler Murray throwing but, for what it's worth, it looks like Kyler will be back in there this week
               * He does do returns, so that helps
               * At the Seahawks (20th)
            * Duvernay
               * He just keeps doing his thing where he gets 3 or 4 points in the return game and also gets a couple of receptions on top
               * He scored a touchdown two weeks ago and even got a carry last week
               * He's only been below 6.5 points once this season, all the way back in Week 2
               * At the Bears (30th)
      * Charles takes Schex
      * Pat projection: Schex
      * Charles prediction
   * Mitch (4-6, .001/.002/.000, 66%) vs. Quinn (2-8, .000/.000/.000, 34%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.099
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * Mitch leads the all-time 7-2 and is riding a five-game winning streak dating back to Week 7 of 2018
      * Patrick takes Mitch
         * Jordan Howard or Devin Singletary
            * Howard
               * The numbers over the past few weeks have been great but they've been earned in the absence of Miles Sanders, who seems like he'll be back this week
               * It's tough to know how limited Sanders will be coming back from injury but we know the matchup will be tough
               * Hosting the Saints (2nd)
            * Singletary
               * Meanwhile, Devin Singletary's rushing usage has kinda settled at 6-ish carries a game and he's done okay but not great with it
               * He does have these occasional games where he'll get a bunch of receptions, though, which help his fantasy totals out a bit
               * Hosting the Colts (3rd)
      * Charles takes Quinn
      * Pat projection: Quinn
      * Charles prediction
   * Koci/Mueller (1-9, .000/.000/.000, 26%) vs. Trevor (4-6, .001/.002/.000, 74%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.086
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * Trevor leads this all-time series 14-7 and has won seven of the last eight meetings, including back in Week 5
      * Patrick takes Koci/Mueller
         * Nico Collins or Ronald Jones
            * Collins
               * Collins is looking relatively integrated into the offense at this point
               * Over the last four games, he's made 13 catches from 18 targets for 152 yards
               * Still looking for his first touchdown but there's a reasonable chance he finds it this week, I'd say
               * At the Titans (32nd)
            * Jones
               * Man, who knows
               * It seems like his mostly game ends up being five carries for like twenty yards and there's a chance he scores a touchdown
               * He is very boring but, honestly, a boring but roughly assured two points kinda plays in this lineup
               * Hosting the Giants (26th)
      * Charles takes Trevor
      * Pat projection: Koci/Mueller
      * Charles prediction


* Let's Remember Some Guys?


* High Scorer's Corner: Jason
   * APPLAUSE
   * Jason scored 166.30
   * 2nd scoring title this season
   * 2nd scoring title all-time (T-13th overall)
      * Believe it or not, that's more scoring titles than Quinn has in his 7.5 seasons of ownership
   * IF JASON HASN'T SENT IN ANYTHING:
People usually send these into me but Charles told me before the show that Jason sent this one to him instead
