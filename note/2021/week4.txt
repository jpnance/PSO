* Game Previews and Risky Player Options for Week 4
   * 16 of the 19 (.842) teams that started 4-0 ended up in the playoffs
   * 18 of the 34 (.529) teams that started 3-1 ended up in the playoffs
   * 14 of the 44 (.318) teams that started 2-2 ended up in the playoffs
   * 4 of the 30 (.133) teams that started 1-3 ended up in the playoffs
   * 0 of the 21 (.000) teams that started 0-4 ended up in the playoffs
   * Patrick (3-0) vs. James/Charles (2-1)
      * All-time series is tied at 3-3 but James/Charles have won two of the last three meetings
      * Patrick takes Patrick
         * I was gonna give you Dawson Knox or Robert Tonyan again but, meh, I'm gonna start Knox
         * Hunter Renfrow or Jakobi Meyers
            * Renfrow
               * Had a great start to the season, scoring 8.0, 8.3, and then 14.6 points
               * This past week, he had five catches for 77 yards and a touchdown
               * No fewer than five catches in any game
               * Stats are good but the matchup is not
               * At the Chargers (3rd)
            * Meyers
               * The fantasy points don't pop out at you but the receptions might
               * Through three weeks, Meyers has 19 catches for 176 yards; has yet to find the end zone
               * Last week was a 9-catch 94-yard effort and he got targeted 14 times
               * Who knows what the Patriots are but check out the matchup
               * Hosting the Buccaneers (32nd)
      * Charles takes James/Charles
      * Pat projection: Patrick
      * Charles prediction
   * Jason (3-0) vs. Quinn (1-2)
      * Josh Allen Revenge Game
      * Patrick takes Jason
         * Chuba Hubbard or Mecole Hardman
            * Hubbard
               * With Christian McCaffrey out, Hubbard is expected to be the guy
               * His numbers in the immediate aftermath of the CMC injury look fine; he didn't score but he didn't really need to because the Panthers were playing the Texans
               * Preseason, I know a bunch of people out there felt that Chuba Hubbard would immediately be a huge beneficiary if CMC were to get hurt
               * At the Cowboys (4th)
            * Hardman
               * Ever the enigma but an RPO mainstay, Hardman has gone from being a deep threat speedster to a reliable every-down option to now, I guess, a slot guy?
               * He scored last week against the Chargers and had five catches the previous week against the Ravens
               * At the Eagles (2nd)
      * Charles takes Quinn
      * Pat projection: Jason
      * Charles prediction
   * Keyon (2-1) vs. Mitch (1-2)
      * Always a fun one, except for Mitch
      * Keyon leads the all-time series 8-3 and swept the two-game series last year
      * Patrick takes Keyon
         * Chase Claypool or Allen Robinson
            * Claypool
               * Pretty solid start to the season for Claypool, at least on peripherals: 15 catches for 211 yards.
               * No touchdowns yet but what remains of Ben Roethlisberger is certainly still throwing to him
               * Hosting the Packers (8th)
            * Robinson
               * Allen Robinson is finally playing how I've been assuming he plays for like five years now
               * Just ten catches for 86 yards through three games; a touchdown saved him in Week 2 but it has been slim pickins for him so far this year
               * Hosting the Lions (14th)
      * Charles takes Mitch
      * Pat projection: Keyon
      * Charles prediction
   * John/Zach (2-1) vs. Luke (0-3)
      * John/Zach lead this all-time series 8-7 and the champs have won six of the last seven meetings
      * Charles takes John/Zach
      * Patrick takes Luke
         * Luke has a ton of options this week and I guess it feels like he has to start Cordarrelle Patterson
         * Brandon Aiyuk or Zack Moss
            * Aiyuk
               * Caught a touchdown this past week but, really, has been otherwise dreadful so far this season
               * Grand total of five catches for 43 yards and a touchdown
               * He contributes a little in the punt return game
               * Hosting the Seahawks (23rd)
            * Moss
               * Awesome again last week, the second week of the season that he was active
               * Last week: 13 carries for 60 yards; 3 catches for 31 yards and a touchdown
               * That's more carries than Devin Singletary, to be clear
               * Hosting the Texans (28th)
      * Pat projection: Luke
      * Charles prediction
   * Koci/Mueller (0-3) vs. Schex (2-1)
      * Our two three-time champs
      * One of the only two series that Schex does not have a winning record in
      * Koci/Mueller lead the all-time series 9-7 and swept the season series last year
      * Patrick takes Koci/Mueller
         * Amusingly, I also had this fundamental decision
         * Henry Ruggs or Kendrick Bourne
            * Ruggs
               * Pretty good so far
               * Only eleven catches but 237 yards and a touchdown
               * He's not Darren Waller but Derek Carr is very much looking for him
               * At the Chargers (3rd)
            * Bourne
               * Has not been pretty good so far but did have a great game last week against the Saints
               * To the tune of six catches for 96 yards and a touchdown
               * Who knows how long it'll last but…
               * Hosting the Buccaneers (32nd)
      * Charles takes Schex
      * Pat projection: Schex
      * Charles prediction
   * Brett (1-2) vs. Trevor (1-2)
      * Brett won the first-ever matchup of these franchises last year
      * Charles takes Brett
      * Patrick takes Trevor
         * Whether this is a real decision Trevor is considering may depend on if Josh Jacobs starts but Darrell Henderson himself may not play and, just, wow, it's bad over there right now
         * Robby Anderson or Austin Hooper
            * Anderson
               * Going in totally the wrong direction this year
               * Just one catch for eight yards last week and only five catches for 103 yards (one touchdown) on the season
               * I guess it's just not working with Sam Darnold the same way it did with Terry
               * At the Cowboys (26th)
            * Hooper
               * He's had acceptable stats for he is
               * Not much going on last week but two catches and a touchdown will work just fine for a tight end
               * I'm not gonna spend any more time trying to justify Austin Hooper
               * At the Vikings (19th)
      * Pat projection: Trevor
      * Charles prediction


* Let's Remember Some Guys?


* High Scorer's Corner: Patrick
   * Patrick scored 173.38
   * 1st scoring title this season
   * 18th scoring title all-time (3rd overall)
   * Back on September 18, 2013, I wrote an LM note called "71 Weeks Later". The week prior, my team (at that point Pat/Quinn) scored the fewest points in the league. What was interesting about that was that it was the first time in our league's regular season existence that I'd owned the low score in a week. When I think of my legacy as an owner in this league, that goofy little tidbit is something that sticks in my brain, even if it sticks only in my brain.
   * It's not a stat I've paid any particular attention to through the years but, today, I decided to write a little database query and see if it's still active, along with what everybody's best non-low-score streaks are. Remember, every single week, a non-low-score streak is broken.
   * I can't decide if this is surprising or not but that 71-game non-low-score streak is now just the second-longest such streak in our history and it was only bested in Week 13 last year by Schex, who's currently riding a 75-game streak dating back to Week 13 in 2015.
   * After Schex (75) and myself (71), the next-longest such streak belongs to Keyon, a 66-game streak that started in Week 11 of 2014 but came to an end in Week 7 of 2019.
   * After that, there's a really sizable drop-off, with nobody else even in the 50s, although Koci/Mueller earning the low score in Week 1 this year ended their longest run at 49 weeks.
   * Anyway, just thought I'd bore everyone with some stats for a few minutes. That's the Corner.
