            * Charles: 4-2
            * Total: 7-5
         * Overall

* Game Previews and Risky Player Options for Week 2
   * 2-0 isn't a magic bullet of a record and we certainly don't know how the stats will shift now that we're playing 15 games instead of 14
   * Nevertheless, in our history, we've had 45 teams get off to a 2-0 start but only 29 of them have ended up making the playoffs
   * That means that a 64.4% of 2-0 records end up making the playoffs
   * Still, it's better than starting out 1-1 (18/58, .310) or 0-2 (5/45 .111)
   * Mitch (1-0) vs. Schex (1-0)
      * Schex leads the all-time series 7-4 but they've alternated results in the last four meetings and Schex won the most recent one
      * Charles takes Mitch
      * Patrick takes Schex
         * Wish I could run it back but Daniel Jones is on TNF
         * Diontae Johnson or JuJu Smith-Schuster
            * Johnson
               * 10 targets last week but only five catches for 36 yards; touchdown ends up salvaging the day
               * Hosting the Raiders (16th)
            * Smith-Schuster
               * 8 targets last week but only four catches for 52 yards
               * Both of them clearly get work so it's a tough call to make
               * Hosting the Raiders (16th)
      * Pat projection: Schex
      * Charles prediction
   * Keyon (1-0) vs. Patrick (1-0)
      * JAGUAR GAME
      * Both teams started off the previous season 2-0 so one of them is going to be worse off after two games than they were last year
      * All-time series is knotted at 10-10 but Keyon has won the last two in a row
      * Charles takes Keyon
      * Patrick takes Patrick
         * Robert Tonyan or Dawson Knox
            * Tonyan
               * Huge year last year but there were a lot of stats out there pointing to a touchdown regression
               * The Packers just couldn't get anything going against the Saints so it's hard to know what to take away from that game
               * Hosting the Lions (20th)
            * Knox
               * Caught all four of his targets last week for 41 yards
               * I think it's unlikely that Knox will emerge as a serious every-week touchdown threat but he's not a totally nothing player either
               * At the Dolphins (21st)
      * Pat projection: Patrick
      * Charles prediction
   * Trevor (1-0) vs. James/Charles (0-1)
      * Trevor leads the all-time series 6-2 but lost the match last year
      * Patrick takes Trevor
         * Robby Anderson or Leonard Fournette
            * Anderson
               * Had a solid year last year but only had one catch on three targets in Week 1
               * Granted, that one catch was a 57-yard touchdown
               * We know the Saints can get after the quarterback
               * Hosting the Saints (4th)
            * Fournette
               * Nine carries and five catches in Week 1 but didn't really do a ton with all that work
               * That said, Ronald Jones had an even worse day so it's not like Fournette's role is at risk or anything
               * Hosting the Falcons (24th)
      * Charles takes James/Charles
      * Pat projection: Trevor
      * Charles prediction
   * Jason (1-0) vs. Koci/Mueller (0-1)
      * Jason looking for his franchise's first 2-0 start since 2014 Daniel
      * Koci/Mueller looking to avoid their first 0-2 start since 2012 (when they were just Koci!)
      * Charles takes Jason
      * Patrick takes Koci/Mueller
         * Carlos Hyde or Sammy Watkins
            * Hyde
               * We know the Hyde story: he's not "really" the guy but he's Urban's guy
               * Nine carries for 44 yards; two receptions for another 14 yards last week
               * Urban is an enigma but 11 touches is something
               * Hosting the Broncos (1st)
            * Watkins
               * Caught four of eight targets for 96 yards last week, mostly owing to a fourth-quarter 49-yard grab
               * He's like the third or fourth option in the offense but he's in there
               * Hosting the Chiefs (9th)
      * Pat projection: Jason
      * Charles prediction
   * John/Zach (0-1) vs. Brett (0-1)
      * John/Zach won the first meeting between these two franchise last year
      * Charles takes John/Zach
      * Patrick takes Brett
         * Rondale Moore or James White
            * Moore
               * Looked pretty good in his first NFL game
               * Four catches on five targets for 68 yards and 3.5 more points on return yardage
               * For being the third-ish wide receiver, that's pretty good production
               * Hosting the Vikings (18th)
            * White
               * Did his James White thing where he catches the ball a lot but doesn't get carries
               * Came out of the week with 6.1 points, which I feel like we should dub "The James White"
               * In any case, he's definitely a part of the offense and they want to get the ball to him
               * At the Jets (20th)
      * Pat projection: Brett
      * Charles prediction
   * Luke (0-1) vs. Quinn (0-1)
      * Quinn is looking to avoid his fourth straight 0-2 start
      * Quinn leads the all-time series 5-3 but lost the only meeting last year
      * Charles takes Luke
      * Patrick takes Quinn
         * Anthony Firkser or Blake Jarwin
            * Firkser
               * Exited Wednesday's practice with a knee injury that we don't know the extent of
               * He and Jarwin both play at the same time on Sunday so you'll have injury protection if Firkser can't go
               * Three catches on four targets for 19 yards in week one
               * At the Seahawks (4th)
            * Jarwin
               * He and Dalton Schultz kinda split duties last week
               * Jarwin caught three of four targets for 20 yards but Schultz caught all six of his targets
               * At the Chargers (22nd)
      * Pat projection: Luke
      * Charles prediction
