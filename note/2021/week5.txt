* Game Previews and Risky Player Options for Week 5
   * 8 out of 10 (.800) 5-0 teams made the playoffs (2012 Keyon and 2020 Koci/Mueller)
   * 19 out of 27 (.703) 4-1 teams made the playoffs
   * 17 out of 36 (.472) 3-2 teams made the playoffs
   * 8 out of 37 (.216) 2-3 teams made the playoffs
   * 0 out of 38 1-4 or 0-5 teams made the playoffs
   * Keyon (3-1) vs. Jason (4-0)
      * Jason is the last remaining 4-0 team and will seek to become the eleventh 5-0 team in our history
      * First all-time meeting between these owners and it is a huge one
      * Patrick takes Keyon
         * The issue hasn't gone away so this is a Week 4 run-back
         * Chase Claypool or Allen Robinson
            * Claypool
               * Missed last week's game, still might miss this week's game
               * He hasn't caught a touchdown yet but 15 catches for 211 yards in three games sounds solid to me
               * Hosting the Broncos (19th)
            * Robinson
               * Coming off his best receiving yardage game of the season: three catches for 63 yards, no touchdown
               * It's a mess, Justin Fields is starting, although it's hard to imagine the situation being any worse than it already is
               * At the Raiders (7th)
      * Charles takes Jason
      * Pat projection: Keyon
      * Charles prediction
   * John/Zach (2-2) vs. James/Charles (3-1) 
      * James/Charles are averaging 18ppg more than John/Zach but only lead them in all-play by two wins
      * The all-time series is tied at 4-4
      * Patrick takes John/Zach
         * Another run-back
         * Teddy Bridgewater or Taylor Heinicke
            * Bridgewater
               * Got concussed and left the game early in Week 4
               * Going through the protocol this week, though, and seems to be on track to play
               * He and Heinicke both play at the same time so you'll have injury protection
               * We know who Teddy is: two great games, a whatever game, and an injury game
               * At the Steelers (22nd)
            * Heinicke
               * Had a great game in Week 4: 23/33, 290 yards, three touchdowns and added 43 rushing yards
               * Amazing day. Oh, by the way, Heinicke and the Football Team were playing the Falcons last week
               * Gonna be a little different this week
               * Hosting the Saints (6th)
      * Charles takes James/Charles
      * Pat projection: James/Charles
      * Charles prediction
   * Brett (2-2) vs. Schex (3-1)
      * Brett seeking to match his 3-2 record from last year
      * Schex started 5-0 in 2019 but hasn't started 4-1 since 2010
      * Schex won both meetings last year
      * Charles takes Brett
      * Patrick takes Schex
         * Kinda feels like this is a gimme but the other stuff I saw was either similarly as gimme, ineligible this week, or just yet another Carr vs. Jones
         * James Conner or Michael Carter
            * Conner
               * Has enjoyed a couple of really nice weeks in a row, with 29 carries, 93 yards, and four touchdowns over that span
               * Maybe you think the 3.2ypc over that span is troubling but the matchup seems promising
               * Hosting the 49ers (28th)
            * Carter
               * Rookie running back who has not looked great so far this year: 37 carries for 127 yards and a touchdown
               * That is a higher ypc (3.4) than Conner but it's been below 3.0 in each of the last two games
               * He is coming off a game against the Titans in which he scored his first career touchdown, so maybe that can jump-start him a little bit
               * At the Falcons (19th)
      * Pat projection: Schex
      * Charles prediction
   * Luke (1-3) vs. Patrick (3-1)
      * JAGUAR GAME
      * Patrick leads the all-time series 9-8 and won the most recent meeting (the infamous 0.01-point game) but lost four in a row before that
      * Charles takes Luke
      * Patrick takes Patrick
         * Jakobi Meyers has a tough matchup this week but, with 26 targets over the last two games, it feels like he's just kinda gotta be in there
         * Honestly, I feel like I could throw Antonio Brown into the mix somewhere here, too, but for today...
         * Mike Davis or Hunter Renfrow
            * Davis
               * Strictly been "not a disaster" this year. He's scored at least 6.3 points in every game but he's topped out at 8.6
               * 3.1 ypc for Davis so far this season is a half-yard worse than his career average
               * It's really the receptions that are saving him so far this year (16 receptions for 80 yards)
               * Hosting the Jets (31st)
            * Renfrow
               * Just does his "five or six reception" thing every week and sometimes scores  a touchdown
               * His peripherals are very consistent: five or six catches, 6-9 targets, 50-70 yards, 0-1 touchdowns
               * Hosting the Bears (27th)
      * Pat projection: Patrick
      * Charles prediction
   * Mitch (1-3) vs. Quinn (1-3)
      * Both teams have nearly identical scoring averages (130 and change) and all-play records (10-34 and 11-33)
      * Mitch leads the all-time series 6-2 and has won the last four meetings in a row
      * Charles takes Mitch
      * Patrick takes Quinn
         * Honestly not too much here once Quinn replaces Myles Gaskin with Damien Williams
         * Marvin Jones or Jamison Crowder
            * Jones
               * Fantasy points are going in the wrong direction: 13.7, 11.5, 6.2, and 2.4 last week, even with DJ Chark leaving the game early
               * Overall, you like the 20 catches, 218 yards, and two touchdowns
               * You're a little confused by why Chark's injury didn't lead to a better game but maybe it's just an outlier
               * Hosting the Titans (32nd)
            * Crowder
               * Future PSO Hall of Famer, we hope
               * He was hurt for the first three games of the season but made his season debut in Week 4: 7 receptions  on 9 targets for 61 yards and a touchdown and, oh by the way, the Jets won that game
               * At the Falcons (30th)
      * Pat projection: Quinn
      * Charles prediction
   * Koci/Mueller (0-4) vs. Trevor (1-3)
      * Koci/Mueller have never started 0-5
      * Trevor has never started 1-4
      * One of these teams is about to get off to their worst all-time start after five weeks
      * Trevor leads the all-time series 13-7 and has won six of the last seven dating back to 2016
      * Patrick takes Koci/Mueller
         * I think if Christian McCaffrey plays, there's really nothing interesting about this lineup so, for the purposes of this RPO, let's give Koci/Mueller a backup plan if CMC misses another week
         * Demetric Felton or Taysom Hill
            * Felton
               * Rookie who's gotten two receptions each of the last three games, but that's not really what he is
               * He's a return guy!
               * On the season, he's got 154 punt return yards and 54 kick return yards, however, he had just 17 combined return yards in his most recent game
               * Maybe you're concerned about that?
               * At the Chargers (17th) but, you know, he's gotten zero carries this season
            * Hill
               * I wrote a few notes about Ronald Jones and then decided I'm just too sick of talking about the most boring player in fantasy football. This is way more fun
               * Taysom Hill is a backup quarterback but also scores points
               * In fact, he scored 15 of them last season as he scored two rushing touchdowns
               * He also had a rushing touchdown the week before that, so he definitely gets playing time
               * At the Football Team (32nd)
      * Charles takes Trevor
      * Pat projection: Trevor
      * Charles prediction


* Let's Remember Some Cuts?


* High Scorer's Corner: Schex
   * Schex scored 183.58
   * 2nd scoring title this season
   * 40th scoring title all-time (1st overall)
   * Through four weeks, my all-play records have only used zeros and ones: 11-0, 10-1, 1-10, and 11-0. 


   * Also, in honor of my big "four-oh" for scoring titles, I went back and looked at who they were all against. Pat, you'll be surprised that only 5 of the 40 were against you. I've done it to every owner who played more than a year, though I only got Syed once before he quit. I've done it the most against James. Eight times total, three of which were with Charles.
