* Game Previews and Risky Player Options for Week 6
   * Jason (5-0) vs. James/Charles (3-2)
      * This is tied for the second-best combined all-play record in a Week 6 matchup of all-time
      * Patrick takes Jason
         * Julio Jones or Mecole Hardman
            * Jones
               * Been banged up the past couple of weeks (and also the past couple of decades)
               * In three games, he's got 12 receptions for 204 yards and, although he has yet to score, you do like those averages
               * Hosting the Bills (1st)
            * Hardman
               * The RPO legend is having a solid season: 22 catches for 199 yards and a touchdown
               * Coming off a 9-catch day against those same tough Bills
               * At the Football Team (25th)
      * Charles takes James/Charles
      * Pat projection: James/Charles
      * Charles prediction
   * John/Zach (3-2) vs. Patrick (3-2)
      * All-time series is tied 9-9 but John/Zach have won the last three meetings
      * Charles takes John/Zach
      * Patrick takes Patrick
         * The lineups seems basically set to me so it's back to this well
         * Hunter Renfrow or Jakobi Meyers
            * Renfrow
               * Renfrow just keeps doing it: 6 more catches on 8 more targets for 56 more yards in Week 5
               * 28 for 305 and 2 on the season
               * At the Broncos (23rd)
            * Meyers
               * Came back to Earth a little in Week 5: 4 catches on 5 targets for just 56 yards
               * He still has 31 catches on 46 targets on the season, though, and also does weird trick plays sometimes
               * Hosting the Cowboys (27th)
      * Pat projection: Patrick
      * Charles prediction
   * Schex (4-1) vs. Quinn (1-4)
      * Schex leads the all-time series 7-1, Quinn's only win coming in 2019, which, amusingly, was when Schex finally broke through and won his first solo-ownership championship
      * Patrick takes Schex
         * James Connor or Darrell Williams
            * Connor
               * Connor's been very good as the Cardinals' main guy, sorta
               * The ypc isn't very good but the fantasy numbers are: double digits or nearly so in each of the last three games, all of which include touchdowns
               * That said, although the carries are there, you can't like seeing the 3.2 ypc average
               * At the Browns (7th)
            * Williams
               * Seems like he's gonna be the guy in place of the injured Clyde Edwards-Helaire
               * We don't have a ton to go off this season but: 26 carries for 99 yards and 2 touchdowns; could be a lot worse, right?
               * He also gets a couple receptions a game
               * At the Football Team (26th)
      * Charles takes Quinn
      * Pat projection: Schex
      * Charles prediction
   * Luke (2-3) vs. Brett (2-3)
      * Last year, Syed/Kuan relinquished their team immediately after playing Bret/Luke; Luke took over the vacant franchise but didn't meet Brett the rest of the season.
      * That means this is the first Buckeye Bowl!
      * Charles takes Luke
      * Patrick takes Brett
         * Injuries, bye weeks, and trading away Aaron Jones have decimated Brett's roster, so I guess this is what we're going with
         * This is for the OP slot!
         * David Njoku or Parris Campbell
            * Njoku
               * Going into last week, he'd been dreadful with just four catches for 35 yards.
               * However, in Week 4 at the Chargers, Njoku had a 7-catch, 149-yard, 1-touchdown day. That's like a quarter of a season for most TEs!
               * Hosting the Cardinals (1st)
            * Campbell
               * Parris Campbell will likely never make an RPO XI but I feel like he'd be in the RPO XXII
               * He is truly the definition of "just a guy"
               * On the season: 9 catches for 111 yards and 0 touchdowns
               * Last week at the Ravens, he had his best game so far with 4 catches for 56 yards
               * Hosting the Texans (4th)
      * Pat projection: Luke
      * Charles prediction
   * Mitch (2-3) vs. Trevor (2-3)
      * The combined all-play record of this matchup is 27-83, yet one of these teams is going to get to .500 this week
      * Trevor leads the all-time series 6-4 and has won five of the last six meetings
      * Charles takes Mitch
      * Patrick takes Trevor
         * I don't think there's a remotely interesting call on offense here
         * Shaq Thompson or Nick Bolton
            * Thompson
               * Pretty solid season so far: 25 tackles, 16 solos, a sack and an INT
               * Had a real nice Week 1 but has been sorta ho-hum since
               * He was hurt and missed the Week 5 game but he and Bolton play at the same time this week so you'll have injury protection
               * At Dak Prescott and the Cowboys
            * Bolton
               * Been a little bit better than Thompson: 31 tackles, 21 solos, but no big plays
               * He's only had one game below 5.5 points and he scored 7.5 against the Bills last week
               * At Taylor Heinicke and the Football Team
      * Pat projection: Trevor
      * Charles prediction
   * Keyon (3-2) vs. Koci/Mueller (0-5)
      * Keyon leads this all-time series 11-5 and has won four of the last five
      * Charles takes Keyon
      * Patrick takes Koci/Mueller
         * Odell Beckham or Kendrick Bourne
            * Beckham
               * Man, Odell is just an RPO guy these days, I guess
               * It's been very slow-going for Beckham in his three games of action so far: just 9 catches on 19 targets for 124 yards and no touchdowns
               * Moreover, he's been limited to just two catches in each of his last two games
               * Frankly, it's a bit disheartening how the Browns scored 42 points at the Chargers last week but Beckham only gets 2 catches for 20 yards
               * Hosting the Cardinals (19th)
            * Bourne
               * Bourne has played all five games
               * Although he has roughly the same targets in five as Beckham does in three (22 compared to 19), Bourne has been a lot more efficient: 17 catches for 207 yards and a touchdown
               * He's actually caught all eight of his targets over the past two weeks but, of course, that means he's only made eight catches in the most recent two games
               * Hosting the Cowboys (27th)
      * Pat projection: Keyon
      * Charles prediction
