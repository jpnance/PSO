* Game Previews and Risky Player Options for Week 14
   * John/Zach (9-4, .529/1.000/.045, 51%) vs. Jason (9-4, .512/1.000/.037, 49%)
      * Playoff interest level: 1.165
      * Decision interest level: 0.495
      * The winner of this game clinches a playoff spot
      * The loser is still in it but is in terrible shape
      * John/Zach are the final franchise that Jason has yet to play against in his PSO career
      * John/Zach lead the weekly head-to-head series 7-6 on the season
      * Patrick takes John/Zach
         * Just because John has already made his call here doesn't mean this isn't still the most interesting call on the roster
         * Thanks for submitting, John, but we're gonna go the only reasonable direction we can
         * Taylor Heinicke or Teddy Bridgewater
            * Heinicke
               * Been in double-digits each of the last four games, although two of those games were 10.XX
               * If you look at his completion percentages, he's a remarkably accurate quarterback: 77% over those four games
               * He's been somewhat of a running quarterback but, over those same four games, the carries have been there but the yardage hasn't really: 16 carries for 57 yards and no touchdowns
               * Hosting the Cowboys (17th)
            * Bridgewater
               * Been in double-digits three of the last four games
               * He's really done a good job of just not really throwing interceptions and also not really taking sacks
               * When you eliminate those things, 240 yards and a touchdown can end up being a very startable performance
               * Over the last three weeks when they've both played, the correct answer has been: Heinicke, Terry, Heinicke, so do you believe in patterns?
               * Hosting the Lions (22nd)
      * Charles takes Jason
      * Pat projection: Jason
      * Charles prediction
   * Keyon (10-3, .989/1.000/.981, 44%) vs. James/Charles (10-3, .000/1.000/.999, 56%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.009
      * Decision interest level: 0.829
      * The winner of this game clinches a playoff spot
      * The loser is still looking great for the playoffs
      * A Keyon win bumps him up to 82% for The Decision whereas a James/Charles win would most positively affect Schex, bumping him up to 65%
      * Keyon leads the all-time series 5-3 and has won five of the last six, which happens to be every meeting during the James/Charles era
      * Patrick takes Keyon
         * This is as set a roster as I think I've ever seen so we're just gonna give you a little softball that I think is nonzero plausible
         * Joe Burrow or Zach Wilson
            * Burrow
               * He's a little banged up but he seems fine; nevertheless, if he doesn't play and we don't know that by the first wave of games, you'll have to take the zero *if you pick him*
               * He's not been great over the last month
               * He's been in double-digits the last two games but posted 6 points and 2 points in the two before that
               * He's like the anti-Terry: he throws interceptions and takes sacks but doesn't throw enough touchdowns to offset them: so Terry's 12s are Joe's 8s
               * Hosting the 49ers (21st)
            * Wilson
               * Has had some dreadful games this season but also has had some pretty promising ones
               * Most recently, he went for 19 against the Eagles
               * He's scored a rushing touchdown in each of the last two games, so maybe that continues
               * Hosting the Saints (27th)
      * Charles takes James/Charles
      * Pat projection: James/Charles
      * Charles prediction
   * Trevor (6-7, eliminated, 23%) vs. Schex (10-3, .970/1.000/.872, 77%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.030
      * Decision interest level: 0.172
      * Schex clinches a playoff spot with a win and virtually loses The Decision with a loss
      * Schex leads this all-time series 11-8 but Trevor has won two straight meetings
      * Charles takes Trevor
      * Patrick takes Schex
         * DeAndre Hopkins or Van Jefferson
            * Hopkins
               * We already know the book on DeAndre Hopkins–especially since we read that book last week
               * With Kyler Murray back in Week 13, Hopkins only made two catches but one of them was in the end zone, salvaging an almost-double-digits day
               * It was Hopkins' first game in over a month, so it's left as an exercise to the fantasy owner what they want to take away from that
               * It's his eighth touchdown on the season, though, so you obviously know that he will always garner end zone looks
               * Hosting the Rams (9th)
            * Jefferson
               * Nice game last week: 6 catches for 41 yards and a touchdown
               * In fact, he's scored a touchdown in each of the past two games
               * It's at least possible that Cooper Kupp misses this game, which could be good for Jefferson, but his volume is a little suspect
               * At the Cardinals (10th)
      * Pat projection: Trevor
      * Charles prediction
   * Mitch (6-7, eliminated, 56%) vs. Brett (5-8, eliminated, 44%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.000
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * Pretty big game for both teams because both still have their own first round draft picks
      * Mitch has a 67% chance at the #2 overall pick with a win; Brett has a 23% chance at it with a win
      * Mitch won the only all-time meeting between these two teams
      * Charles takes Mitch
      * Patrick takes Brett
         * Over the last two games, Devin Duvernay has had his two worst fantasy performances on the season: 5.1 and 6.35
         * Once again, Brett, just start Devin Duvernay.
         * Noah Fant or Cole Kmet
            * Fant
               * I think this is the third RPO appearance in a row for Fant?
               * I dunno, man, he catches balls but they're just not in the end zone anymore
               * 12 catches for 104 yards over the last three games, so you know he's at least got a floor but that ceiling has been tough to reach this year
               * Hasn't scored a touchdown in almost two months
               * Hosting the Lions (14th)
            * Kmet
               * 12 catches for 118 yards (also no touchdowns) over his last three games
               * Ever-so-slightly better than Fant but Kmet hasn't scored a touchdown all season
               * Maybe the compelling reason to pick Kmet is just that he's got a couple of games where it feels like the offense flows through him whereas Fant is more of a consistent 3-5 catch guy?
               * At the Packers (13th)
      * Pat projection: Brett
      * Charles prediction
   * Patrick (4-9, eliminated, 54%) vs. Quinn (3-10, eliminated, 46%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.000
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * This game is probably what decides whether I get the 5th pick in the rookie draft next year or the 6th, dependent on whether I win or lose
      * Patrick leads the all-time series 7-3 and has won six meetings in a row
      * Patrick takes Patrick
         * Honestly, I have no clue if this is gonna end up being a call I make because there's so much injury stuff in flux but, just in case I need it, Charles, who do you like better:
         * Mike Davis or D'Wayne Eskridge
            * Davis
               * Coming off his best fantasy performance of the season: 4 carries for 32 yards and a touchdown to go along with 4 receptions for 37 yards
               * Cordarrelle Patterson's back but, honestly, neither his absence nor his return has seemed to affect Davis: he just gets like eight touches a game and good luck with those
               * At the Panthers (4th)
            * Eskridge
               * Also coming off his best fantasy performance of the season: 3 catches for 35 yards and a touchdown (indeed, every one of those numbers is a season best)
               * He was a second round pick by the Seahawks this year but got concussed in the first game of the season and spent two months in the protocol
               * He finally was able to return about a month ago but didn't get much play
               * There's not a ton to say about him because the previous week was really the first that he's been any kind of serious option
               * He did spend one week on kick return duties but I'm not sure if that's a normal thing
               * At the Texans (18th)
      * Charles takes Quinn
      * Pat projection: Patrick
      * Charles prediction
   * Luke (5-8, eliminated, 79%) vs. Koci/Mueller (1-12, eliminated, 21%)
      * Playoff interest level: 0.000
      * Decision interest level: 0.000
      * Nothing really riding on this game except Brett's draft position (he owns Luke's pick)
      * Patrick takes Luke
         * Jarvis Landry or Chase Claypool
            * Landry
               * Couple nice games in a row, including the most recent game in which he had over 100 yards receiving
               * He's a little banged up and Baker Mayfield is his quarterback but you've gotta care at least a little about a WR who's made 14 catches for 163 yards and a touchdown over the last three games
               * Hosting the Ravens (16th)
            * Claypool
               * Volume has gone way down over the last two games but it hasn't totally affected anything: just five catches but 134 yards in that span.
               * It's kinda strange because you look at his numbers and he looks so involved with the offense that you may be surprised to learn that he's got only one double-digit game this entire season (with two that are pretty close but not quite there)
               * He gets the yards but he just doesn't get the touchdowns: only one on the season and it even happened to be a rushing touchdown
               * At the Vikings (31st)
      * Charles takes Koci/Mueller
      * Pat projection: Luke
      * Charles prediction


* Let's Remember Some Guys?


* High Scorer's Corner: James/Charles
   * APPLAUSE
   * James/Charles scored 186.26
   * 2nd scoring title this season
   * 4th scoring title all-time (12th overall)
